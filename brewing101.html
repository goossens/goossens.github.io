                  Hi, My name is <a href="index.html">Johan Goossens</a> and
                  I've been brewing beer as a hobby for over 10 years. You can
                  see my own current setup and recipes on my
                  <a href="brewing.html">Brewing</a> page.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2018, I did a quick beer brewing 101 with demonstration for
                  a number of my colleagues. When I retired, I was cleaning up
                  files and found the materials I used. So now that I have time
                  on my hands, I decided to publish this knowledge so others can
                  benefit as well. Please use the arrow below to start the
                  tutorial.

          <p>
            Like everything else in the world, making beer is simple as long as
            you follow the process. In this overview, the homebrew process is
            split into six steps that are executed sequentially. Each of these
            steps in a section and you can read them sequentially or use the
            navigations links at the top of the page.
          </p>

          <p>
            So you see, it's really simple: you extract sugars, put them in a
            liquid, boil it and make it bitter, turn the sugar into alcohol,
            make it pretty and carbonate it. Everybody can do this.

          <h2 class="pb-2">Mashing</h2>
          <p>
            Assuming we see getting all the ingredients as step zero, the fun
            starts with step one: <strong>the mash</strong>. So we haven't even
            started yet and we can already raise a first point. Where do all
            these crazy brewing terms come from? Well, I have no idea but I
            always suspected that beer brewers were a little drunk and simply
            bastardized common words. Just stand in from of a mirror, pull a
            silly face and say the words mash and wort 20 times. You'll see what
            I mean.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea behind the mash is to extract sugars from fermentables that
            we can later turn into alcohol. For today's homebrewers there are
            two and half different ways to handle this step. Firstly, we're
            going to look at using <strong>malt extracts</strong> which were
            created by someone else. Think of it as outsourcing the first step
            so we don't have to start with a lot of equipment. Using extracts,
            everybody can make beer on the kitchen stove. Secondly, we'll look
            at <strong>whole grain</strong> mashing which is what beer makers
            have been doing for centuries. This process is a little more complex
            and requires more equipment.
          </p>
          <h3>Extract brewing</h3>
          <p>
            As stated above, extract brewing is an entry level technique to
            allow as many people as possible to start with the hobby. Two types
            of extracts can be purchased from a homebrew store and often they
            sell them in kits to include the other ingredients as well. In both
            cases someone else has extracted sugars from fermentables and we
            just simply add them to water. Dry Malt Extract or DME comes in
            powder form and Liquid Malt Extract (LME) comes as the name suggests
            in liquid form.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.022.jpeg"
              alt="Extract Brewing"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            I've used both types and I have a preference for DME since it can be
            bought in a very light color and it doesn't have that caramel taste
            that I so often had with LME. Please note that others swear by LME
            but they may be making a different style of beer. For my Belgian
            style Tripels, Witbier and Pale Ales, light DME was better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using an extract massively simplifies the early steps (as we will
            see later). In the end, mashing is as simple as dissolving, mixing
            and starting the boil.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.023.jpeg"
              alt="Dissolve and Boil"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Earlier I stated there were two and a half ways of mashing and I was
            referring to a hybrid approach between <em>extract</em> and
            <em>whole grain</em> brewing. Often kits have a small amount of
            crushed grain that will be steeped in water of a certain temperature
            (often around 155F) for 30 minutes or so. You only need a bag for
            this and it's basically the same idea as steeping thee. The benefit
            of that is that you can add interesting flavors and it gives the
            sensation that the beer is more fresh and rich. The entire time I
            did extract brewing, I used this style.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.024.jpeg"
              alt="Steeping"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            So if you are only interested in extract brewing, you can skip the
            rest of this section and go straight to the
            <a class="page-scroll" href="#boiling">boiling process</a>. In fact,
            if you never brewed before, I recommend you do this as the next part
            of this section is probably the most complicating part of beer
            making. Once you understand the whole process, come back here and
            learn how it's done for real.
          </p>
          <h3>Fermentables</h3>
          <p>
            All beer brewing is based on converting sugars into alcohol so let's
            have a look at where these sugars come from. Firstly, there are the
            traditional fermentables like barley, wheat and rye. Most beers are
            made from sugars extracted from these grains.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.005.jpeg"
              alt="Fermentables"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also possible to use other sources for our sugars and these
            are typically added to the grains above for flavor (like fruity
            beers like Kriek Lambic) or to make stronger beers (like adding beet
            sugar for strong Abbey Ales). It is also possible to make alcoholic
            beverages by just using these fermentables. Think of wine or hard
            seltzers but these are obviously not
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer">beers</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.006.jpeg"
              alt="Fermentables"
            />
          </p>
          <h3>Malting Barley</h3>
          <p>
            So how do we extract sugars from grain? Well, let's start with
            Barley. It turns out it's not easy to get the sugars released from
            it. The slide below sums up our problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.007.jpeg"
              alt="Barley"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            So to get to the sugars, a three step process called
            <strong>malting</strong> is used. Firstly, the grains are steeped to
            soften them up and then a germination process is started to open
            them up. Obviously we don't want to grow fields of barley at this
            point so we need to stop the process. Through a drying/roasting
            process, the germination process is halted and the barley is ready
            for our brewing process.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.008.jpeg"
              alt="Malting"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the barley is roasted at the end, different roasting times and
            temperatures will result in different products just like with
            coffee. Malts can therefore be roasted lightly to dark which results
            in a different color and flavor. Lighter beers typically uses malts
            from a lighter roast and darker beers like stouts use a darker
            roast.
          </p>
          <p>
            The level to which the malt is roasted is measured in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_measurement#Colour"
              >degrees lovibond</a
            >
            which measures the color of the resulting beer. Lighter beers like
            lagers have a low number and darker beers like stouts have a higher
            number.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.009.jpeg"
              alt="Lovibond"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of you might already be getting scared at this but but don't
            fear, the malting process is typically done in large industrial
            facilities. As home brewers we simply buy the malt in the color we
            want for our recipes. In fact, I don't know of a single home brewer
            that malts his/her own grain even though I assume they exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beer making supply stores typically offer up a wide variety of malts
            and they typically come whole or crushed. I always buy mine crushed
            as I don't own a malt crusher. My local store crushes the malt to my
            liking and since I use it immediately, it's just as fresh as when I
            would do it myself. Many home brewers however crush their own grain
            as they want full control over the process (e.g. determine
            coarseness).
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"

              alt="Crushing"
            />
          </p>
          <h3>Extracting Sugars</h3>
          <p>
            Well, we're finally ready to extract those sugars from our malt.
            I'll first explain the manual way and later explain how we can
            simplify and/or automate this process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sugar extraction is the process of creating
            <strong>sweet wort</strong>, which is typically a three step
            process: <strong>mashing</strong> to extract the sugars,
            <strong>lautering</strong> to filter the wort and
            <strong>sparging</strong> to get the last sugars from the grain.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.011.jpeg"
              alt="Extracting"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Mashing is where we add warm <strong>strike water</strong> to the
            crushed grain which is typically at room temperature. A little bit
            of math is involved here as we want the combination of warm water
            and cool grain to end up at the desired mash temperature. Luckily
            these days there are great apps and websites that will do these
            calculations for us.

            During the mashing process (or at the end), we use the
            <strong>grain bed</strong> to filter the sweet wort also called
            lautering. This is done by circulating liquid from the bottom of the
            <strong>mash tun</strong> to the top either by hand or with a pump.
            Mash tuns typically have false bottoms to support this and the grain
            bed does a great job at catching the small particles that resulted
            from crushing the grain.

          </p>
          <p>
            Once the mashing and lautering processes are completed, it is time
            to separate the sweet wort from the grain and rinse the grain to
            extracted every last bit of sugar. This is called sparging and
            people have come with a lot of ways to do this. Sparging is
            typically done with water warmer than the wort. As you can see
            later, if you automate the mashing and lautering process, there are
            plenty of people who argue that sparging is not even required.

            So if this wasn't obvious before, beer brewing is a religion and
            everybody has their own opinion. I can guarantee you that posting
            this simple 101 online will draw fire from the high priests of home
            brewing. Don't be discouraged by these types though, you'll soon be
            making better beer than they are.

          <h3>Mashing Equipment</h3>
          <p>
            As you figured out, extracting sugars is a complicated process and
            home brewer ingenuity has gone crazy over the years on how to do
            this on a small scale and within budget. Firstly, there the people
            (including me) that used gravity and manual labor to move the wort
            through the process. This makes for a long brew day with a lot of
            steps and heavy lifting. As a beer drinker, I alway though this was
            a good idea as I was burning some of the calories I would consume
            later.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.017.jpeg"
              alt="Equipment"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, there are people who invest a lot of money and create a
            mini version of a commercial brewery with stainless steel vessels
            and pumps. Both this and the manual/gravity method will work but in
            both cases, you have a lot of stuff to clean at the end of your brew
            day. Again, this could be a positive as you're burn calories before
            you consume them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.018.jpeg"
              alt="Brewery"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            In my case, I took an intermediate step and went from extract
            brewing to <strong>brew in a bag</strong>. With this technique, you
            are extracting sugars from your grain in the same vessel that you
            use for the boil. The idea is really simple as you steep your grains
            in a large brew pot just like steeping thee for the entire city of
            London in one go (slight exaggeration).
          </p>
          <p>
            This step allowed me to move to whole grain brewing without a great
            investment (I already had a fancy brew pot for extract brewing) and
            I felt like I was moving forward. My only negative was that my sugar
            extraction efficiency was poor and my beers weren't measuring up to
            the Belgians I was trying to recreate.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"

              alt="Brew in a Bag"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Given that &quot;brew in a bag&quot; was not going to get me to make
            my favorite Abbey Brews, I did go down the manual/gravity mashing
            route described above for a while. Unfortunately my patience and
            endurance were not compatible with this approach and my beer quality
            became inconsistent and unpredictable. It was time to either go back
            to extract brewing (nothing wrong with that as I managed to make
            some great beers using this technique) or to find a different way.
          </p>
          <p>
            The answer turned out to be an electric all-in-one brewing system
            that automates the mashing. lautering and boiling process. This is
            also a significant investment but it simplifies the brewing process
            and it offers a repeatable process that creates a more consistent
            outcome. So I've invested in a Braumeister and never looked back.

            />
          </p>
          <h3>Multi-Step Infusion</h3>
          <p>
            When you use the manual mashing process, it can be very hard to keep
            the temperatures at the right level. This is why I always did single
            step infusions where you try to keep the mashing temperature as
            constant as possible during the entire mashing process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you move to an all electric system, you can move to a
            multi-step infusion process where you use different temperatures to
            extract the sugars. This is the process used by commercial beer
            brewer as it allows them to extract more and the right kind of
            sugars to achieve the effect they are after. If you are interest in
            this, the links at the bottom of this page will recommend books and
            web site that will explain chemical processes like the acid rest,
            protein rest, starch conversion or saccharification and diacetyl
            rest. This stuff will make your brain hurt long before you have a
            hangover.

            As I'm interested in Belgian Ales, I quickly learned of a man called
            Jean de Clerck who was and probably still is one of the most
            influential beer brewing scientist. So until I fully understand the
            chemistry behind the mashing processes, I've adopted his
            <strong>mash schedule</strong> for a number of my Belgian recipes.

            If you made it to this part of this tutorail, you deserve a medal.
            The mashing process to extract sugars and create sweet wort, is the
            most complicated part of beer brewing. you can see why beginners
            start with extract brewing. I must say however that by investing in
            electric brewing, I have simplified the process as well and the
            automation allows for very consistent products. If I could only
            understand all the chemistry behind all of this so I could reason an
            outcome rather than rely on trial and error.
