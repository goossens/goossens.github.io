                  Hi, My name is <a href="index.html">Johan Goossens</a> and
                  I've been brewing beer as a hobby for over 10 years. You can
                  see my own current setup and recipes on my
                  <a href="brewing.html">Brewing</a> page.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2018, I did a quick beer brewing 101 with demonstration for
                  a number of my colleagues. When I retired, I was cleaning up
                  files and found the materials I used. So now that I have time
                  on my hands, I decided to publish this knowledge so others can
                  benefit as well. Please use the arrow below to start the
                  tutorial.

          <p>
            Like everything else in the world, making beer is simple as long as
            you follow the process. In this overview, the homebrew process is
            split into six steps that are executed sequentially. Each of these
            steps is a section and you can read them sequentially or use the
            navigations links at the top of the page to jump back and forth.

            make it pretty and carbonate it. Everybody can do this.

          <p>
            Assuming we see getting all the ingredients as step zero, the fun
            starts with step one: <strong>the mash</strong>. So we haven't even
            started yet and we can already raise a first point. Where do all
            these crazy brewing terms come from? Well, I have no idea but I
            always suspected that beer brewers were a little drunk and simply
            bastardized common words. Just stand in from of a mirror, pull a
            silly face and say the words mash and wort 20 times. Now do it after
            a few beers. You'll see what I mean.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea behind the mash is to extract sugars from fermentables that
            we can later turn into alcohol. For today's homebrewers there are
            two and half ways to handle this step. Firstly, we're going to look
            at using <strong>malt extracts</strong> which were created by
            someone else. Think of it as outsourcing the first step so we don't
            have to start with a lot of equipment. Using extracts, everybody can
            make beer on the kitchen stove. Secondly, we'll look at
            <strong>whole grain</strong> mashing which is what beer makers have
            been doing for centuries. This process is a little more complex and
            requires more equipment.
          </p>
          <h3>Extract brewing</h3>
          <p>
            As stated above, extract brewing is an entry level technique to
            allow as many people as possible to start with the hobby. Two types
            of extracts can be purchased from a homebrew store and often they
            sell them in kits to include the other ingredients as well. In both
            cases someone else has extracted sugars from fermentables and we
            just simply add them to water. Dry Malt Extract or DME comes in
            powder form and Liquid Malt Extract or LME comes as the name
            suggests in liquid form.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.022.jpeg"
              alt="Extract Brewing"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            I've used both types and I have a preference for DME since it can be
            bought in a very light color and it doesn't have that caramel taste
            that I so often had with LME. Please note that others swear by LME
            but they may be making a different style of beer. For my Belgian
            style Tripels, Witbier and Pale Ales, light DME was better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using an extract massively simplifies the early steps (as we will
            see later). In the end, mashing is as simple as dissolving, mixing
            and starting the boil.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.023.jpeg"
              alt="Dissolve and Boil"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Earlier I stated there were two and a half ways of mashing and I was
            referring to a hybrid approach between <em>extract</em> and
            <em>whole grain</em> brewing. Often kits have a small amount of
            crushed grain that will be steeped in water of a certain temperature
            (often around 155F) for 30 minutes or so. You only need a bag for
            this and it's basically the same idea as steeping thee. The benefit
            of that is that you can add interesting flavors and it gives the
            sensation that the beer is more fresh and rich. The entire time I
            did extract brewing, I used this style.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.024.jpeg"
              alt="Steeping"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            So if you are only interested in extract brewing, you can skip the
            rest of this section and go straight to the
            <a class="page-scroll" href="#boiling">boiling process</a>. In fact,
            if you never brewed before, I recommend you do this as the next part
            of this section is probably the most complicating part of beer
            making. Once you understand the whole process, come back here and
            learn how it's done for real.
          </p>
          <h3>Fermentables</h3>
          <p>
            All beer brewing is based on converting sugars into alcohol so let's
            have a look at where these sugars come from. Firstly, there are the
            traditional fermentables like barley, wheat and rye. Most beers are
            made from sugars extracted from these grains.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.005.jpeg"
              alt="Fermentables"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also possible to use other sources for our sugars and these
            are typically added to the grains above for flavor (think of fruity
            beers like Kriek Lambic) or to make stronger beers (like adding beet
            sugar for strong Abbey Ales). It is also possible to make alcoholic
            beverages by just using these fermentables. Think of wine or hard
            seltzers but these are obviously not
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer">beers</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.006.jpeg"
              alt="Fermentables"
            />
          </p>
          <h3>Malting Barley</h3>
          <p>
            So how do we extract sugars from grain? Well, let's start with
            Barley. It turns out that it's not easy to get the sugars released
            from it. The slide below sums up our problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.007.jpeg"
              alt="Barley"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            So to get to the sugars, a three step process called
            <strong>malting</strong> is used. Firstly, the grains are steeped to
            soften them up and then a germination process is started to open
            them up. Obviously we don't want to grow fields of barley at this
            point so we need to stop the process. Through a drying/roasting
            process, the germination process is halted and the barley is now
            ready for our brewing process.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.008.jpeg"
              alt="Malting"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the barley is roasted at the end of the malting process,
            different roasting times and temperatures will result in different
            products just like with coffee. Malts can therefore be roasted
            lightly to dark which results in a different color and flavor.
            Lighter beers typically uses malts from a lighter roast and darker
            beers like stouts use a darker roast.
          </p>
          <p>
            The level to which the malt is roasted is measured in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_measurement#Colour"
              >degrees lovibond</a
            >
            which measures the color of the resulting beer. Lighter beers like
            lagers have a low number and darker beers like stouts have a higher
            number.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.009.jpeg"
              alt="Lovibond"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of you might already be getting scared at this but but don't
            fear, the malting process is typically done in large industrial
            facilities. As home brewers, we simply buy the malt in the color we
            want for our recipes. In fact, I don't know of a single home brewer
            that malts his/her own grain even though I assume they exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beer making supply stores typically offer up a wide variety of malts
            and they typically come whole or crushed. I always buy mine crushed
            as I don't own a malt crusher. My local store crushes the malt to my
            liking and since I use it immediately, it's just as fresh as when I
            would do it myself. Many home brewers however crush their own grain
            as they want full control over the process (e.g. determine
            coarseness).
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.010.jpeg"
              alt="Crushing"
            />
          </p>
          <h3>Extracting Sugars</h3>
          <p>
            Now we're finally ready to extract those sugars from our malt. I'll
            first explain the manual way and later explain how we can simplify
            and/or automate this process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sugar extraction is the process of creating
            <strong>sweet wort</strong>, which is typically a three step affair:
            <strong>mashing</strong> to extract the sugars,
            <strong>lautering</strong> to filter the wort and
            <strong>sparging</strong> to get the last sugars from the grain.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.011.jpeg"
              alt="Extracting"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Mashing is where we add warm <strong>strike water</strong> to the
            crushed grain which is typically at room temperature. A little bit
            of math is involved here as we want the combination of warm water
            and cool grain to end up at the desired mash temperature. Luckily
            these days there are great apps and websites that will do these
            calculations for us. The temperature of the mash is important is it
            determines how the sugars are extracted and what kind of sugars we
            want. The science behind this is way beyond a Brewing 101 but at the

          <p>
            Throughout the mashing process (or just at the end), we use the
            <strong>grain bed</strong> to filter the sweet wort which is called
            <strong>lautering</strong>. Lautering is done by circulating liquid
            from the bottom of the <strong>mash tun</strong> to the top either
            by hand or with a pump. Mash tuns typically have false bottoms to
            support this and the grain bed does a great job at catching the
            small particles that resulted from crushing the grain.
          </p>

              alt="Lautering"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the mashing and lautering processes are completed, it is time
            to separate the sweet wort from the grain and rinse the grain to
            extracted every last bit of sugar. This is called
            <strong>sparging</strong> and people have come up with a lot of ways
            to do this. Sparging is typically done with water warmer than the
            wort.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can see later, if you automate the mashing and lautering
            process, there are plenty of people who argue that sparging is not
            even required.

            So if this wasn't obvious before, beer brewing is a religion and
            everybody has their own opinion. I can guarantee you that posting
            this simple 101 online will draw fire from the high priests of home
            brewing. Don't be discouraged by these types though, you'll soon be
            making better beer than they are.

          <h3>Mashing Equipment</h3>
          <p>
            As you figured out, extracting sugars is a complicated process and
            home brewer ingenuity has gone crazy over the years on how to do
            this on a small scale and within budget. Firstly, there the people
            (including me) that used gravity and manual labor to move the wort
            through the process. This makes for a long brew day with a lot of
            steps and heavy lifting. As a beer drinker, I alway though this was
            a good idea as I was burning some of the calories I would consume
            later.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.017.jpeg"
              alt="Equipment"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, there are people who invest a lot of money and create a
            mini version of a commercial brewery with stainless steel vessels
            and pumps. Both this and the manual/gravity method will work but in
            both cases, you have a lot of stuff to clean at the end of your brew
            day. Again, this could be a positive as you're burn calories before
            you consume them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"

              alt="Brewery"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            In my case, I took an intermediate step and went from extract
            brewing to <strong>brew in a bag</strong>. With this technique, you
            are extracting sugars from your grain in the same vessel that you
            use for the boil. The idea is really simple as you steep your grains
            in a large brew pot just like steeping thee for the entire city of
            London in one go (slight exaggeration).
          </p>
          <p>
            This step allowed me to move to whole grain brewing without a great
            investment (I already had a fancy brew pot for extract brewing) and
            I felt like I was moving forward. My only negative was that my sugar
            extraction efficiency was poor and my beers weren't measuring up to
            the Belgians I was trying to recreate.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.019.jpeg"
              alt="Brew in a Bag"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Given that &quot;brew in a bag&quot; was not going to get me to make
            my favorite Abbey Brews, I did go down the manual/gravity mashing
            route described above for a while. Unfortunately my patience and
            endurance were not compatible with this approach and my beer quality
            became inconsistent and unpredictable. It was time to either go back
            to extract brewing (nothing wrong with that as I managed to make
            some great beers using this technique) or to find a different way.
          </p>
          <p>
            The answer turned out to be an electric all-in-one brewing system
            that automates the mashing. lautering and boiling process. This is
            also a significant investment but it simplifies the brewing process
            and it offers a repeatable process that creates a more consistent
            outcome. So I've invested in a Braumeister and never looked back.

            />
          </p>
          <h3>Multi-Step Infusion</h3>
          <p>
            When you use the manual mashing process, it can be very hard to keep
            the temperatures at the right level. This is why I always did single
            step infusions where you try to keep the mashing temperature as
            constant as possible during the entire mashing process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you move to an all electric system, you can move to a
            multi-step infusion process where you use different temperatures to
            extract the sugars. This is the process used by commercial beer
            brewers as it allows them to extract more and the right kind of
            sugars to achieve the effect they are after. If you are interest in
            this, the links at the bottom of this page will recommend books and
            web site that will explain chemical processes like the acid rest,
            protein rest, starch conversion or saccharification and diacetyl
            rest. This stuff will make your brain hurt long before you have a
            hangover.

            As I'm interested in Belgian Ales, I quickly learned of a man called
            Jean de Clerck who was and probably still is one of the most
            influential beer brewing scientist. So until I fully understand the
            chemistry behind the mashing processes, I've adopted his
            <strong>mash schedule</strong> for a number of my Belgian recipes.

            If you made it to this part of this tutorail, you deserve a medal.
            The mashing process to extract sugars and create sweet wort, is the
            most complicated part of beer brewing. you can see why beginners
            start with extract brewing. I must say however that by investing in
            electric brewing, I have simplified the process as well and the
            automation allows for very consistent products. If I could only
            understand all the chemistry behind all of this so I could reason an
            outcome rather than rely on trial and error.

          <h2 class="pb-2">Boiling</h2>
          <p>
            The purpose of <strong>the boil</strong> is twofold. Firstly, we
            need to sterilize the liquid and secondly, we need to
            <strong>bitter up</strong> the <strong>sweet wort</strong> with
            <strong>hops</strong> and turn it into a
            <strong>bitter wort</strong> that becomes the beer we all love.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the first point, it is important to recognize that cleanliness
            and sterilization are important in beer brewing. We don't want
            bacteria to enter our final product causing possible health hazards
            but we also don't want bad smells or awful flavors. The boil is the
            final step in sterilizing our wort and from the moment we end the
            boil, we enter a world where extreme caution is required and the
            focus has to be on food safety and product quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            For most recipes however, the boil is about bittering the wort in
            accordance with the style you are going for. Do we want a semi-sweet
            Pilsner or do we want an over-the-top, super bitter IPA or anything
            in between? Well, there are as many answers to this question as
            there are beer recipes. Hops come in a variety of flavors and they
            all cause a different effect based on how much you use and how long
            they are part of the boil. I would submit that the popularity of
            micro breweries is to a large extent a direct result of hop
            varieties and the endless combinations of using new ones with well
            established ones.
          </p>
          <h3>Hop Schedule</h3>
          <p>
            If you study beer recipes, even those that are clones of well known
            commercial products, the <strong>hop schedule</strong> always seams
            to be different. Now, when you just start to brew beer, this can be
            a daunting challenge but in the end, this is a great area for
            experimentation. Imagine a classic Belgian recipe but using citrusy
            hops from California instead of traditional European varieties. For
            some this might be sacrilegious but for others, this might be the
            perfect confused beer that gets them exited about the next batch.
            Like cooking, brewing beer gives you the option to stay with
            tradition or explore new possibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            So let's come back to planet earth and boil our wort. Typically a
            boil is between 60 and 90 minutes and we have points during that
            time where we add hops. It is very typical to have different hop
            varieties in a single recipe and people often use terms like aroma
            or bittering hops to describe the ingredients of their hop schedule.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.026.jpeg"
              alt="Hops"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            So, where do we get our hops? Obviously, we can grow hops in our
            backyard if we have room for very tall vines (25 to 30 feet) that
            quickly turn into a jungle if we don't manage them. For most of us
            city dwellers, this is not an option so we buy hops from a home brew
            supply store who sells them either as dried flowers or compressed
            pellets. I have to admit that I've tried both forms and in the end,
            I like all of them based on brewing technique. If you throw them
            straight into a boil, whole dried flowers are easier to remove
            because pellets fall apart. If you use some sort of hop filter or
            hop spider, pellets are just as easy and given that more hop
            varieties are available in pellet form (at least where I live), I
            typically use more pellets than dried flowers.
          </p>
          <h3>International Bitterness Units (IBUs)</h3>
          <p>
            In beer brewing, bitterness can be measured using
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Bitterness_Units_scale"
              >International Bitterness Units or IBUs</a
            >. A lower number indicates a beer that is less bitter like a German
            Hefeweizen and a higher number indicate high bitterness like many of
            today's IPAs. Many breweries, bars and restaurants have started to
            list the IBU level of their beers so learning the scale not only
            helps when you brew, it also let's you pick a favorite style while
            ordering a beer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.027.jpeg"
              alt="IBUs"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            For homebrewers, it is hard to measure IBUs as the test equipment is
            very expensive. You can however calculate the IBU level of your brew
            if you know the acid level of the hops used and the boil duration of
            those hops. Most beer recipe apps have a builtin calculator and the
            <a class="page-scroll" href="#resource">resources</a> section below
            has links to popular app.
          </p>
          <h3>End of the Boil</h3>
          <p>
            As pointed out before, the end of the boil is the point where we
            need to become very focussed on cleanliness and sterilization. While
            our wort is still simmering and bittering, the liquid is guaranteed
            to be sterile but from the moment we start to lower the temperature,
            we need to make sure we keep nasty stuff out of our wort to ensure
            the best possible product. Step one in this process is to get the
            wort down in temperature (from boiling to roughly room temperature)
            as soon as possible. We don't want the wort to sit around for too
            long in an open vessel as that is an invitation for contamination.
          </p>
          <h3>Cooling the Wort</h3>
          <p>
            The most economical way to cool the wort is to use a wort chiller
            like in the picture below. By running cold water through the
            chiller, the wort can quickly be lowered in temperature. In the
            winter this goes faster as tap water is colder than in the summer.
            This is why beer brewers use all kinds of techniques to speed this
            up. Some use a pre-chiller to make the water colder, others use ice
            water and a circulating pump. Professionals might even use
            industrial glycol chillers to speed up the process. I've always used
            a regular chiller and it has served me well.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"

              alt="Cooling"
            />
          </p>
          <h3>Keeping it Sanitized</h3>
          <p>
            To keep things sterilized, everything that touches the beer after
            the boil must be sterilized. Obviously you can use heat to do this
            by putting things first in an oven or dishwasher but for most of us,
            the use of food grade sanitizers is fast and effective. These
            sanitizers (like StarSan) are used by many brewers as well as other
            parts of the food industry. Any object you want to sterilize has to
            be in contact with the sterilizer for a minute or so and you can use
            it immediately without drying as the sterilizer is food safe. This
            is really simple and effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/brewing101/brewing.029.jpeg"
              alt="Sanitizers"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            In my case, I make a 2 gallon batch of sanitizer on brew day (you
            buy it concentrated and only need 1 once per 5 gallons) and use it
            to sanitize spoons, hoses and the fermentation vessel.
          </p>
          <h3>Measuring Gravity</h3>
          <p>
            Once we transfer our bitter wort from the boiling vessel to a
            fermentation vessel, we have one more optional step. If we want to
            figure out how strong our beer will be, we can measure the alcohol
            level at the end of fermentation but this requires very expensive
            lab equipment. An alternative is to measure the wort's gravity
            (amount of dissolved solids (mainly sugars) in the liquid) before
            and after the fermentation. Based on these number we can determine
            how much sugar has been converted to alcohol (telling us the
            strength of the beer) and how much sugar is still left in the beer
            (telling us how sweet or dry the beer will be).
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"

            />
          </p>
          <p>
            The simplest way to measure gravity is to use a hydrometer that uses
            buoyancy to perform the measurement. This is a low cost solution
            used by many homebrewers. An alternative is to use a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractometer"
              >refractometer</a
