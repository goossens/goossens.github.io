                  Welcome to my &quot;War on Cancer&quot; blog. On this page I
                  chronicle my battle with and full recovery from stage 2
                  muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The story is in chronological

                  The motivation for this blog was to inform my family and

                  sent emails to those interested but as the list grew, it
                  became too hard to track whom I told what. A second purpose of
                  this blog is to inform others who may one day find themselves
                  in the same predicament.

          <h2 class="pb-2">The Story Before the Story</h2>
          <p>
            Throughout my life, I've had kidney stones (about 9, lost count) and
            every few years I went through a very painful ordeal. As a result, I
            have been going to a urologist every year for regular checkups and
            even more frequently when stone symptoms popped up. I have not
            knowingly passed a stone in the last 5 years although I had symptoms
            on multiple occasions.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me, kidney stone pain is either the classic sharp pain in the
            back, discomfort in the lower tummy or a radiating pain in my upper
            legs or groin. Another feature of kidney stone pain is that it could
            be digital; one minute there's extreme pain with vomiting, and the
            next it's completely gone. Most of my symptoms over the last couple
            of years were like that.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2015, I thought I had another stone (sharp pain and a little
            blood in my urine). X-rays were inconclusive (small stones don't
            always show well) but a CT scan with contrast fluid showed that I
            had no stones. The CT scan did however show that I had a
            &quot;partially contracted bladder that is grossly
            unremarkable&quot; (not making this up, this was in the report of
            the radiologist). As the symptoms went away, it was assumed that the
            stone had passed before the scan without me feeling it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Christmas 2017 I had another episode. Back to the urologist but the
            outcome was the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the hindsight of a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias"
              >Monday morning quarterback</a
            >, it is likely that my bladder cancer has been around for a while
            but it was always misinterpreted as another stone by me and my
            urologists.
          </p>
          <h3>Christmas 2018</h3>
          <p>
            In November/December 2018, &quot;the kidney stone pain&quot; came
            back but this time the symptoms were a little different. The pain
            was the same, there was no visible blood but I had rapidly increased
            my daytime trips to the bathroom from 4 to about 10. Again the
            urologist couldn't find anything and ordered another CT scan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before I even had the results, I became incontinent during the night
            and my night time bathroom excursions went from never to about 8
            times. As a result, I no longer hit deep sleep and felt like I was
            shooting a jet lag version of the movie Groundhog Day. It did not
            take long to find out that sleep deprivation is debilitating and
            often used as a form of torture.
          </p>
          <p>
            The CT scan again showed no signs of stones so this time we had to
            look for something else.
          </p>
          <h3>Prostatitis, Jan 2019</h3>
          <p>
            The first guess of my urologist was a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"
              >Urinary tract infection (UTI)</a
            >
            or
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatitis"
              >bacterial prostatitis</a
            >. My urine contained some bacteria but not clinically significant.
            They put me on 6 weeks of antibiotics but the symptoms got worse.
            The next diagnosis was non-bacterial prostatitis. The problem with
            this is that it has no known cause, there is no test for it and
            there is no cure. This was really frustrating as control freaks like
            me don't deal well with the &quot;unknown unknown&quot;. I think I'm
            heading for depression. Prostate cancer was ruled out as my PSA
            levels were extremely low and my full bloodwork was clean.
          </p>
          <p>
            My urologist suggested that we should do a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystoscopy">cystoscopy</a>
            but recommended to wait a few weeks as my prostate was very tender.
            I told him I understood the possible pain but I would rather know
            the state of my bladder and have some pain than to deal with this
            debilitating uncertainty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, I did that painful cystoscopy a few days later and it turned
            out that the inside of my bladder contained a few bumps. The first
            words out of my urologist's mouth were: &quot;<em
              >that's not cancer!</em
            >&quot;. Apparently
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer"
              >bladder cancer</a
            >
            starts in the bladder liner and grows into the bladder space like a
            cauliflower that turns angry red and starts to bleed. This is
            typically how it's detected. The liner over my bladder's bumps
            looked the same as the rest of the liner. The doctor was puzzled as
            he had never seen this in over 30 years. He ordered a CT scan with
            contrast and recommended a biopsy just to make sure.

          <h3>Biopsy Number One, 14 Feb 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Getting appointments was hard at this point since waiting times were
            weeks to months. Luckily my urologist is the father of my daughter's
            Kindergarten and Elementary School friend. He has been to our house
            dropping off or picking up his daughter several times and as luck
            might have it, both of our daughters are now in the same university.
            He put in the extra effort and cut through the ridiculous medical
            bureaucracy. I got a biopsy scheduled within a week, performed by
            one of his urology friends (my urologist was not available as he had
            to go to some convention).
          </p>
          <p>
            The biopsy however was extremely painful as they damaged my urethra.
            Many years ago, I had a kidney stone surgically removed and it took
            two four-hour sessions to get the darn thing out. They damaged my
            urethra badly and it caused a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_stricture"
              >urethral stricture</a
            >. This was never an issue for me before but during the biopsy, they
            couldn't get the surgical tube through my urethra and probably used
            a little force. Bottom line: I was in extreme pain and pied blood
            for days. The pain was so extreme that even opioids couldn't mask
            it. The most interesting thing about the biopsy was that my second
            urologist told me that he &quot;<em>did not think it was cancer</em
            >&quot;&quot;. But he had to admit he had never seen something like
            this either.
          </p>
          <h3>CT Scan with Contrast Fluid, 20 Feb 2019</h3>
          <p>
            One week later I got the results of the CT scan. It concluded that
            my bladder wall was thickened. It was an &quot;<em
              >inflammation not cancerous</em
            >&quot;&quot;. The scan also confirmed that the rest of the lower
            body was in good shape. From the bottom of my stomach down, all
            organs were good and the lower lymph nodes were clean.
          </p>
          <h3>The Day You Get the Call, 27 Feb 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Your entire life you think about the medial issues you might face
            later in life. In my case, there is no known cancer in my family
            with the exception of a chain-smoking cousin. Both of my parents and
            two grandparents however died of diabetes related heart failure. I
            therefore naively assumed I did not have to worry much about cancer
            but should focus on heart health and watch my blood sugar.
          </p>
          <p>
            A couple of hours before I had an appointment with my original
            urologist (the dad of my daughter's old friend), he was kind enough
            to call me and give me the bad news. This time the conclusion was a
            high grade, fast growing cancer consistent with traditional bladder
            cancer but with a non traditional development. The biopsy was
            reviewed by a few pathologists and they all concluded the same even
            though there was a hint of doubt as to the type of cancer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was at work sitting in my office when I got the call and I only
            recall the event as surreal and numbing. Strangely enough, there was
            also some relief as I finally knew what was going on and I could
            imagine a path to recovery.
          </p>
          <p>
            My urologist offered to let this sink in first and come and see him
            in a few days or keep the appointment that same afternoon. I kept
            the appointment and after telling my wife the results in person (an
            emotional moment I dreaded all the way home), we both went to see
            him.
          </p>
          <p>
            The recommendation from my urologist was to remove the bladder,
            prostate, seminal vesicle and lower lymph nodes (called a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy"
              >radical cystectomy</a
            >
            and to sweep up remaining cancer cells with chemo afterwards. He did
            not perform this procedure himself but the urology group (about 30
            doctors) had a few people who did.
          </p>
          <p>
            My basic options were a) go with experience and use a doctor who has
            done a lot of them but does it by hand or b) go with a young whiz
            kid who has only done them using the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Vinci_Surgical_System"
              >Da Vince robot</a
            >
            but might lack experience. I decided to be a rebel and go young. I
            already figured out this was a fast moving field and I wanted
            somebody who still had two legs in the academic world and could go
            robotic. The Da Vince procedure for removal and reconstruction was
            developed at
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_Hospital"
              >Johns Hopkins Hospital</a
            >
            in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore">Baltimore, MD</a>
            and having someone from the joystick generation operating the
            machine appealed to me. The robot is far more accurate, reduces
            recovery time and minimizes side effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            BTW: in this blog, the terms &quot;whiz kid&quot; and &quot;joystick
            generation&quot; are terms of endearment and respect. As an older
            person who lived his live pursuing innovations, I have the deepest
            respect for those who continue to pursue state of the art
            developments. In the end, I picked the right team and I will forever
            see them as heroes.
          </p>
          <h3>Colonoscopy, 5 March 2019</h3>
          <p>
            As luck might have it, I was already scheduled for a colonoscopy.
            This was now very important to me as a part of my intestines could
            be used as a replacement for my bladder. Obviously, the colon is a
            &quot;long way&quot; away from the part that would be used as a
            replacement but I have a few colleagues whose colon cancer ended up
            in removal of all intestines. I wanted to make sure there was no
            cancer in those regions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially my gastroenterologist wanted to wait for the result of the
            scan and biopsy and canceled my appointment. With charm and
            persistence, I got a quick appointment with a Registered Nurse (RN)
            at the same office and she got my an urgent colonoscopy within days.
            Again the bureaucracy was ridiculous as the scheduler said the next
            appointment was in 6 weeks. When the RN put the cancer word on the
            table, I got an appointment in 2 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            During previous colonoscopies, pre-cancerous polyps were
            found/removed and I was on a 3 year schedule. This time, only 2
            small bumps were removed. They were also pre-cancerous and the
            doctor put me on the 5 year program. I saw this as good news as
            nothing was in the way of getting a &quot;neo bladder&quot; made
            from my intestines.
          </p>
          <h3>On to Urologist number Three, 5 March 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Since I'm now pushing the medical system to the brink, I had an
            appointment with my young urologist on the same day as my
            colonoscopy. I fully expected that we would make a plan for removal,
            reconstruction and chemo but my doctor had other plans.
          </p>
          <p>
            His first point was that this is war and in war you have to know
            your enemy (this is what I heard, not necessarily what he said). He
            was not convinced we knew enough about the cancer yet as my cancer
            did not start in a traditional way, the pathology was not 100%
            conclusive and during the first biopsy they did not get samples from
            my bladder's muscle (this is important to determine if we are
            dealing with stage 1 or 2).
          </p>
          <p>
            He recommended a second, deeper biopsy and sent the specimens to
            high frequency labs where they see more cases like this. The second
            military point was that in war, you have to know your own abilities,
            and he wanted to know more about me. He ordered an upper body CT
            scan with contrast to ensure we did not miss anything and to ensure
            my heart and lungs were healthy enough for aggressive treatment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The average age of a bladder cancer patient is in their early 70s
            and often these people have other complications and they have to
            balance treatment with conditions like diabetes, heart problems or
            high blood pressure. The upper body scan came back clean so for now,
            I know my cancer is limited to my bladder.
          </p>
          <h3>Biopsy Number Two, 15 March 2019</h3>
          <p>
            My second biopsy was one for the ages. Not only did the surgeon have
            the same stricture problem as the first one, he also decided to
            scrape away most of the cancer cells from my bladder wall. We don't
            know why he did that but from the beginning he had stated that if
            possible, he would like to save my bladder. I assume his thinking
            was that since he's causing all this pain anyway, he might as well
            remove the cancer to give him more treatment options.
          </p>
          <p>
            After surgery, he talked to my wife but wisely stayed away from me
            as I might have hurt him. For two days the pain was so bad that if
            someone had offered a medical coma, I would have taken it. There was
            significant bleeding but I guess that was to be expected. Luckily,
            I'm still in decent shape and my body recovered quickly. I stopped
            taking opioids after a few days and my urine was almost running
            clear in a week (it's amazing how fast our body can heal itself).
            Like the first biopsy, I had a catheter for one week to make it heal
            faster.
          </p>
          <h3>Update, 20 March 2019</h3>
          <p>
            My urologist was nice enough to call me with the biopsy results and
            not]let me wait until the appointment one week later. The second
            biopsy confirmed the results of the first one. I have high grade
            bladder cancer and this time they confirmed it did spread to the
            bladder muscle. This means I have stage 2 cancer and his recommended
            procedure is chemo followed by bladder removal/reconstruction. This
            is the reverse sequence of what the first two urologist recommended,
            but a simple Google search confirmed that the younger generation was
            right as that is today's thinking based on solid academic research.
          </p>
          <p>
            My urologist also made an appointment with an oncologist within a
            few days and I would start 4 rounds of chemo shortly thereafter. My
            big robot surgery will be sometime in July/August. Recovery from
            that surgery will be 8 weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since I was already prepared for this after the first biopsy, I'm OK
            with this approach. All the uncertainty from the first biopsy is now
            removed and the war on cancer can now start for real. I'm definitely
            liking the idea of chemo first since it will catch any cancer cells
            that might have escaped from my bladder.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last 10 days have been extremely painful. First the bladder
            biopsy surgery where an area of 2 by 4 inches was scraped away and
            later the catheter that made it impossible to sit, stand or do
            anything without pain. Once the catheter was removed I became more
            mobile even though the pain is not yet gone. Getting good sleep is
            still hard but I do feel a small improvement every day.
          </p>
          <h3>Update, 28 March 2019</h3>
          <p>
            I was too optimistic about the fast recovery from the second biopsy.
            The last couple of days have been very painful and I'm back on
            opioids. I was told this could happen but I assumed it would not
            happen to me. I was wrong (again).

          <h3>Meeting the Oncologist, 29 March 2019</h3>
          <p>
            I had my first meeting with the oncologist and I now have a
            treatment plan for my chemo. Apparently there are two different
            treatments for my cancer. The better version is more aggressive and
            is only tolerated by one in twenty patients. So, as one of the
            younger victims, I've been nominated for best of class treatment and
            will undergo
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy_regimen"
              >MVAC chemotherapy</a
            >. The letters in this acronym stand for four different chemical
            with impossible names. I've decided it stands for &quot;<em
              >My Very Aggressive Chemo</em
            >&quot;.
          </p>
          <p>
            MVAC is administered in two steps. I'll get M on Thursday during a
            one hour session, and VAC on Friday during a five hour session (yes,
            five hours of chemical warfare). This process is repeated four times
            every two weeks. The only exception will be the last round. It will
            be delayed by another week so I can attend my son's college
            graduation ceremony.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the good news is that everything will go faster than expected and
            the outcome will be better. The disadvantage is that it will be more
            miserable. It also means that my bladder removal and reconstruction
            surgery will also be sooner than expected.
          </p>
          <h3>The Week before Chemo, 3 April 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Apparently Mr. Murphy is never far away. About 10 days before my
            first round of chemo, I started to have pain in my urinary tract.
            Initially this was dull but it became so bad that I cold no longer
            sit or lay down without major discomfort. To make matters worse, my
            wife and I had planned a trip to see our kids (who are in college)
            before chemo starts, and although it was great to see them, the pain
            was dominating the whole trip.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/cancer/IMG_6752.jpg"
              alt="introduction"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            On the way back home, I noticed that my urine was also very cloudy
            which made me believe I had an infection. Quickly playing Dr Google
            confirmed that all my symptoms lined up with a UTI. Given that I
            still had antibiotics left from that long &quot;none prostatitis
            treatment&quot;, I decided to self medicate (kids listen to me,
            never do this at home). With long chemo sessions around the corner,
            it was important that I could sit without discomfort so I decided to
            see the urologist or a RN.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sure enough they found a &quot;mixed fauna&quot; in my urine but not
            enough to conclude it was a UTI. Luckily, the RN did prescribe more
            antibiotics and the pain stopped just in time for chemo round one. I
            clearly dodged that bullet even though they did not think it was a
            UTI. Obviously I did not tell them about the self medication.
          </p>
          <h3>Chemo Round One, 8 April 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Last week, I had to complete three things before I started my chemo.
            Firstly I had to get a
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripherally_inserted_central_catheter"
              >PICC</a
            >
            line installed. This is a permanent port they use to draw blood and
            inject the chemicals. The line starts in your arm and ends just
            before your heart so the chemicals are immediately dispersed through
            your entire body. The other advantage is that they don't have to
            poke you every time. It will stay there for 8 weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second thing was a 45 minute heart echo. My CT scan and EKG had
            shown that my heart was good, but the oncologist wanted to make sure
            it could handle the nasty stuff. I passed that test with flying
            colors and the nurse even joked that I could make money on the side
            modeling my heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last bit was the chemo training. This was very useful as a nurse
            explained the process, the chemicals, and the do's and don'ts. So to
            my surprise, I'm not just doing the 1 in 20 MVAC, I'm doing the
            accelerated or &quot;dose dense&quot; version. Normal MVAC is every
            4 weeks, the accelerated version is every 2 weeks (lucky me). The
            sales pitch is that your body has less side affects if you do it
            faster (don't ask me about that logic).
          </p>
          <p>
            So right after the chemo training I entered the chemical warfare
            room and got my M chemical. Not a big event as it was over in 30
            minutes with no side effects. On Friday however, I did my VAC
            chemicals which was advertised as 5 hours. Just like any good
            airline, we had some delays and the entire journey took 6 hours and
            45 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The amount of stuff they put in me was ridiculous (it must have been
            over 3 liters). First saline to hydrate me, then anti-nausea
            medication followed by a bag full of steroids. Finally it was time
            for the V chemical. At this point, three nurses showed up with a box
            full of bags (everything I needed for the rest of the treatment) and
            they spent 5 minutes checking serial numbers, quantities, expiration
            dates and matches with my wristband. Given that this stuff is nasty
            and dangerous, I had to appreciate their attention to detail but at
            one point, I could not help myself and feel like a prisoner on
            death-row.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/cancer/IMG_0108.png"
              alt="the tree"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            The A and C chemicals are really bad apparently as my kidneys had to
            be flushed with 1 liter of saline after the A and half a liter of
            the C to avoid damage. So after almost 7 hours I left the place and
            although I was tired of sitting, I did not feel any different.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of this changed on Saturday when my energy level went down very
            quickly. By the time Sunday came around, I was hitting a wall and
            was sleeping most of the time. Monday morning I started to feel
            better although the progress was very slow.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best way to describe the treatment so far is to be hit by the
            worst flu ever but without the fever. Every muscle and joint aches,
            you have a slight headache, no energy or appetite and you sleep a
            lot. Nausea was minimal but the additional pills they gave me,
            controlled it nicely. The biggest issue I have right now is that I
            can't concentrate. A five minute conversation knocks me out.
          </p>
          <p>
            So overall as the optimist, I can't complain too much as many people
            have far worse symptoms. I know I still have three sessions to go
            and think it will still get worse. Nevertheless, I still feel good
            about the outcome. I did not pick this fight but I will win this
            war.
          </p>
          <h3>Recovering from Chemo Round One, 17 April 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Recovery from the first round of chemo has been a rollercoaster.
            Four days after the chemo session I started to feel better, but good
            and bad days would alternate for another 4 days. It wasn't until one
            week after the chemo that I really improved and was eating well
            again. Actually, I was eating so well that I even gained weight.
          </p>
          <p>
            We were told that I would most likely not lose all my hair but that
            it would thin out. This did exactly happen during the first round of
            chemo. When I washed my hair, little bits came out but not much. The
            other noticeable thing is that my hair is getting thinner and
            softer, and my facial hair has decided to slowdown growth. Less
            shaving for me for a while.
          </p>
          <h3>Chemo Round Two, 23 April 2019</h3>
          <p>
            One day before the second round, I had to do blood work to see how
            my body recovered from the first round. I passed that test with
            flying colors, so I'm ready for round two.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other good news was that I could move my chemo treatments to 8
            o'clock in the morning, right as the office opened. The good part
            about this is that the doctors don't start working until 9 o'clock
            so the waiting rooms are empty. I think I was patient number three
            so from the moment I got into the building, I was hooked up to my
            lovely concoctions within 10 minutes. The entire process took less
            than 5 hours which was a vast improvement over the 6 hours and 45
            minutes of the first round. I've scheduled rounds three and four at
            8 o'clock as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/cancer/IMG_0124.png"
              alt="infusion center"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Round two was different from round one. This time there was no
            honeymoon period as my body immediately recognized what was
            happening and even on the Friday a few hours after the treatment, I
            already started to go down.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tiredness, muscle and joint aches, lack of concentration and that
            general flu sensation were the same. What was different was the
            nausea and I was not able to control it with medication on Sunday or
            Monday. Luckily, Tuesday morning things turned around and I started
            to feel a little better. In under 3 days I lost 5 pounds and a lot
            of hair.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hopefully I can strengthen over the next 10 days so I'll be ready
            for round 3.
          </p>
          <h3>Recovering from Chemo Round Two, 26 April 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Round two has been different than round one. This time there was no
            rollercoaster but the intensity was greater in terms of tiredness
            and nausea. One week after the chemo, I can clearly feel my strength
            coming back and I have yet again some color in my face. I assume my
            white blood cell, red blood cells and platelets are making a strong
            comeback.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest difference however has been my hair as I started to lose
            it rapidly leading me to take drastic hairstyle measures. Funny
            enough, it only affects hair on top of my head and the rest of my
            body is (still) normal.
          </p>

          <h3>PICC Line Drama, 27 April 2019</h3>
          <p>
            As I mentioned earlier, I had a
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripherally_inserted_central_catheter"
              >PICC</a
            >
            line installed in my upper left arm. This line is nothing more than
            a small tube that enters my upper arm and runs to my heart so that
            the dangerous chemicals can be distributed quickly through my entire
            body instead of lingering near an entry point where they could
            potentially damage tissue. The only thing that sticks out of my body
            is a small tube with a port on it that they connect to an infusion
            line when required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every week on Wednesday, the entry area has to be disinfected and
            they put a very sticky antibacterial gel and a see-through cover on
            it so the entry wound can be monitored easily. White mash netting
            that looks like a bandage is put over the whole thing to hold the
            dangling port in place. As I don't feel or notice it much, I got
            into the bad habit of not checking the entry wound every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today as I took a late shower, I noticed a lot of blood around the
            wound covering the entire area of the clear bandage. This spooked me
            a little and had to seek help immediately. With my luck, it was now
            Saturday evening and the only option was an Emergency Room (ER).
            Luckily it was early in the evening so the ER was still quiet. The
            crazies, the intoxicated and the gunshot victims would likely arrive
            much later.
          </p>
          <p>
            After being checked by multiple doctors and nurses, they concluded
            that the clip on my arm that holds the line in place was not mounted
            properly during Wednesday's cleaning and caused the line to move a
            little and start the bleeding. Remedy was simple: take all the stuff
            off, clean it well and reapply new disinfectant gel and cover it
            back up.

            Well, that was easier said than done as the ER did not have the kits
            to treat PICC lines available and none of the nurses had actually
            done it. Problem one was easy to solve. The infusion center that
            cleans my PICC line is literally next door to the ER and it's
            operated by the same organization. Problem was that it's locked.
            Luckily an American ER has security guards on duty to deal with out
            of control patients and I was able to convince the nurse to convince
            the guard to break into the infusion center and get the right
            supplies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second problem was more interesting. The nurse who did the
            cleaning had only seen a PICC line in training many years ago and
            wasn't too comfortable. As I witnessed 5 cleaning sessions already,
            I was able to coach her through the process and get all the right
            bits in the right place while keeping everything sterile. Lesson
            learned: always look at medical procedures performed on you. You
            never know who you might have to coach through the process.

          <h3>Hair Style Fun, 28 April 2019</h3>
          <p>
            After I posted my new &quot;badass&quot; hairstyle on the blog, I
            got a lot of very nice reactions that, for a bit, drew attention
            away from my war on cancer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first good reaction came from a dear friend in California. She
            noted that I totally ROCKED the new style and that I looked like a
            badass MARINE or NAVY SEAL. Luckily her husband stepped in quickly
            and put the word (RETIRED) in that sentence followed by another
            friend pointing out that I might look like a Navy Seal but not the
            one that's on trial for war crimes. Thank goodness for that
            clarification.
          </p>
          <p>
            My family in the Netherlands had a different view as they compared
            me to rock stars like Peter Gabriel and Billy Joel. If you read the
            &quot;about me block&quot; at the end of this blog, you quickly
            realize how fitting that was.

            My own children, who used to binge watch Breaking Bad on Netflix,
            saw a resemblance with the lead character Heisenberg (but without
            the meth lab off course). As a result, I'm no longer a
            &quot;badass&quot; but rather a &quot;Breaking Bad ass&quot;. This
            inspired my wife to take the appropriate pictures.

            So in a few simple days I went from just another guy with cancer, to
            a badass (retired) Navy Seal (that did not commit war crimes), to an
            aging rocker, to a Breaking Bad Ass. Not a bad three day
            transformation.

          <h3>Chemo Round Three, 1-10 May 2019</h3>
          <p>
            From the beginning, I was told that successive treatments would be
            worse in terms of side effects. I my case, this is definitely true
            as I hit deeper lows that also lasted longer. In order for this blog
            to be useful to future patients, I'll give a day by day summary of
            my round 3 journey so other people can benefit form it later.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>1 May</strong> - This is the day before the two day
              treatment and my body already knew what was coming. Most of this
              is a mental game with physical side effects. When I did round 1, I
              didn't know what to expect. Round 2 was worse (certainly in terms
              of nausea) so now my mind is wondering how bad it will get in
              round 3. Stupidly enough, I already started to feel queazy before
              a drop of chemicals was administered as the mind was dominating
              the body.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>2 May</strong> - Day 1 of treatment started with a blood
              test, followed by a consult with a physician's assistant, followed
              by treatment with the M chemical. The results of the blood test
              were good with the exception of white blood cells. Instead of them
              being a little low, they were actually a little high which could
              indicate an infection. As I did not have a fever, they didn't seem
              to be too worried but in an abundance of caution, they put me on
              five days of antibiotics anyway. The pre-drama queasiness
              continued, reenforcing the notion that it truly is mind over
              matter.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>3 May</strong> - Day 2 of treatment started really bad as
              I did not sleep very well. I think there was an element of anxiety
              and nervousness but I basically started the day with nausea before
              the drugs were even administered. The one good thing about been
              tired is that I slept through most of the 6 hours of treatment
              with the VAC chemicals but when I came home I was exhausted and
              the queasiness became worse. I could feel a very fast downward
              trend coming up. May 3rd is also our 31st wedding anniversary. My
              wife and I agreed to celebrate double next year.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>4 May</strong> - Going down hard! As described earlier,
              it's mainly a bunch of flu symptoms like muscle aches, painful
              joints and general tiredness. The difference with the flu is that
              the symptoms seem to be more severe. Sleep is the only remedy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>5 May</strong> - Here comes the nausea! This was a really
              bad day as I couldn't eat or drink anything and I could feel a
              strong mental decline. People around me want to help me so badly
              but even their attempts were hard to handle. I just wanted to be
              left alone even though it is very hard to send away loved ones
              that just wanted to help.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>6 May</strong> - This was by far the worst day of round 3.
              The discomfort in terms of tiredness, muscle and joint aches,
              nausea and lack of energy continued. This was probably the first
              day in this journey where I lost my positive attitude. It was so
              bad that my stupid brain couldn't even see how this could ever get
              better. On top of that, I still couldn't eat or drink, making my
              situation probably even worse. This was one of those days where
              you could hear people say with sufficient drama: &quot;if this
              continues, I would rather die&quot;.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>7 May</strong> - Physically, I think this was the day
              things started to improve slowly. Mentally though, my brain didn't
              spot this yet as I was too busy feeling sorry for myself. Luckily,
              I did sleep a lot so the day went by quickly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>8 May</strong> - More improvements were now noticeable and
              I started to come out of my mini depression. I did however have to
              distract myself as any reminders of cancer, chemo or the treatment
              made me feel physically ill.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>9 May</strong> - Hope and a positive attitude came back as
              the improvement are now coming a little faster. I slept a lot less
              and had my first decent food in a few days.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>10 May</strong> - This day I was supposed to attend the
              farewell lunch of one of my dearest colleagues at an Indian
              restaurant. Normally, I would be the first to show up for a spicy
              curry but the notion of Indian food smells was so off-putting that
              I had to cancel my participation. Overall physical and mental
              improvements are there but not as fast as I would like them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>11 May</strong> - This was the first somewhat normal day
              in round 3. I had regular (small) meals, slept for only 30 minutes
              during the day and the tiredness was bearable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>12 May</strong> - After neglecting this blog for almost 2
              weeks, I finally had enough energy and sufficient attention span
              to write a few entries. Even thinking about this blog triggered
              queasiness. I now have one week to get strong enough for my son's
              graduation and 2 weeks before the final (and probably most awful)
              round of chemo.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>PICC Drama, the Sequel, 9 May 2019</h3>
          <p>
            I'm not having much luck with my
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripherally_inserted_central_catheter"
              >PICC</a
            >
            line. Yesterday was my weekly PICC line cleaning and while taking a
            shower just before I went to the Infusion Center, I noticed that my
            left arm was swollen and discolored. The entire arm was more red
            with a purplish hint. Clearly this was not a good sign and on top of
            it, the area around the PICC line entry wound looked more red than
            before.
          </p>
          <p>
            The nurse at the Infusion Center was very good and took action
            immediately. She got the opinion of a few other nurses and then
            decide to call my oncologist directly. Collectively they decided
            that there was a risk of an infection or even blood clots. My
            oncologist told the nurse that he would order an ultrasound of my
            arm and some other tests to see what the problem was. I should be
            contacted within 24 hours. The nurse did clean the area just in case
            and put on a clean bandage.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I mentioned before, I've been very happy so far with the medical
            treatment but the administrative side remains an abomination. As
            expected (and even predicted by my good nurse), I never got a call
            so I had to become proactive again. As usual, it was hard to get
            passed the automated telephone system and the unpleasant pitbull
            operators but I managed to get in touch with a scheduling secretary
            as well as a triage nurse. True to form, the secretary was useless
            and even rude while the nurse was helpful and saw the potential
            dangers. I had an appointment within 2 hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Medical staff quickly took my vitals and ruled out an infection due
            to the normal temperature and other vital signs. The ultrasound of
            my left arm did however show that I had two blood clots. One in my
            upper arm and one in my armpit. Unfortunately, Thursday is the day
            off for my oncologist but the nurses tracked him down somewhere on a
            golf course and got his guidance. These nurses are saints and if the
            administrative staff was half as human as them, the world would be a
            better place.
          </p>
          <p>
            The doctor's recommendation was not to panic, put me on blood
            thinners for 3 months and monitor closely. &quot;3 months&quot;, I
            asked? I never got a good answer but I suspect the pharmaceutical
            industry is behind it as this new drug that I was given is
            expensive. They gave me 30 days free (a $950.00 value) so they
            clearly have to recoup their &quot;generosity&quot; in the following
            months. Who knows what the second and third month will cost? Good
            news for me is that my bladder removal and reconstruction is within
            this time window and they clearly don't want you to be on blood
            thinners during 9 hours of internal surgery. Hopefully, these blood
            clots don't mess up my schedule as it's starting to look like I
            spent more time on side effects of side effects rather than dealing
            with the real problem. It would be highly ironic if you die from a
            side-effect's side effect when trying to save your life from an
            aggressive cancer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The one remaining issue was the red area around the PICC line. Given
            that there is a three week window between chemo rounds 3 and 4 (due
            to my son's university graduation), I was in no mood for more risks.
            Imagine another complication on graduation day? No, thank you. I
            therefore convinced the nurses to remove the PICC line and accept
            having to get a new one installed just before chemo round 4. The
            nurses thought this was a great plan but needed approval from the
            oncologist. His golf game got interrupted again and he agreed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Update (3 days later): The PICC line removal was simple and
            painless. I did have some bruising for a few days but that was to be
            expected as they use serious pressure to stop the bleeding. The
            entry wound is healing quickly and the redness is almost gone.
          </p>
          <h3>More Side Effects, 13 May 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Well, I concluded too quickly that I was done with side effects. The
            medication prescribed to treat my blood clots caused my bladder to
            bleed again. Because of all my kidney stones, I had learned that it
            doesn't take much blood to make it visible in your urine. My urine
            however wasn't just tinted red, it was red and looked like pure
            blood (a slight dramatization).
          </p>
          <p>
            So here comes &quot;Deja Vu all over again&quot;. I first called the
            urologist and was once again greeted by an automated telephone
            system and unpleasant pitbull operators. They told me it was not
            possible to just walk in and I would get a callback from a nurse. My
            second course of action was to call the oncologist and with a little
            extra drama in my voice, I was able to talk to the triage nurse and
            was asked to come in immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            As always, the oncology medical staff was efficient and very
            helpful. Not only did they think that the bleeding was exacerbated
            by the blood thinners, they actually suspected a Urinary Tract
            Infection (UTI) as my white blood cell count was very high. I was
            again put on antibiotics and they reduced the blood thinner dose.
            Within 4 days the bleeding stopped and the discomfort went away.
            Later the oncology staff confirmed that I had a UTI based on a urine
            culture test.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, 3 days after my first call, I got a callback from a
            urology nurse. I was not amused and let her have it over the phone.
            How come I had to go to an oncologist with a urology problem? Why
            did I almost go to an emergency room to have a doctor there call the
            urologist and get his attention? The nurse was shocked by the
            treatment I received from the admin staff and told me that in case
            of emergency (and bleeding is clearly one of them), I should always
            come to the office and would be helped immediately. Apparently the
            admin staff has quite a reputation and the nurse promised me she
            would raise this issue (again) with the office manager. I thanked
            her for her effort but told her that I would not be holding my
            breath.
          </p>
          <h3>My Son's College Graduation, 18 May 2019</h3>
          <p>
            When I started chemotherapy, I knew that my son's college graduation
            would be somewhere in the middle of it. Luckily my oncologist
            understood the importance of that day and scheduled the chemo in
            such a way that on graduation day, I would be the best I could be.
            This is the reason why there was a three week break between chemo
            rounds 3 and 4 as compared to the usual 2 weeks called for by the
            dose dense MVAC protocol.
          </p>
          <p>
            Graduation day was two weeks after round three and I felt pretty
            good. Our San Diego friends (who are our son's godparents) also came
            and we had a great weekend together. I was able to participate in
            all activities and enjoyed all of them. Having your first child
            graduate from college is a big deal and we were very proud of our
            son who graduated with a double Bachelor's Degree in Communications
            and Film.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/cancer/IMG_0752.png"
              alt="breaking bad ass"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of the severity of round three, I must admit that prior to
            the graduation, my mental state had taken a beating. The hopeless
            optimism that I had at the beginning of chemo wasn't as strong
            anymore which really bothered me during this special weekend. Having
            had kids in my late 30s, I recognized that many key family
            milestones were still to come like our daughter's graduation,
            marriages and possibly grandchildren. I assume every cancer patient
            has these moments where thoughts about future ambitions and
            mortality cross paths. What if I'm not around for those special
            moments? How would the family handle my absence? What will their
            lives look like?
          </p>
          <p>
            I quickly realized that this line of reasoning causes a downward
            spiral into anxiety and depression. Luckily I was reminded of a
            former boss and his words of wisdom. General James Mattis is
            probably one of the most remarkable people I've ever met. He is a
            tough as nails Marine with an exceptional intellect and memory
            (don't play trivial pursuit with him) and an unbelievable sense of
            compassion. I decided to borrow one of his famous quotes and give it
            a twist in an open letter to &quot;cancer&quot;. It definitely
            stopped my mental death spiral in its tracks and I'm now more ready
            for the fourth and final round of chemo.

          <pre><code>Dear Cancer,

I've come in peace without an army as I simply want you to leave my

fucking with me, I'll have to kill you all.

          <h3>Urology Visit, 22 May 2019</h3>
          <p>
            After three rounds of chemo, my urologist wanted to look at my
            bladder to see how the treatment was progressing by performing a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystoscopy">cystoscopy</a>.
            Well, this did not work as planned. I already mentioned earlier that
            I have scar tissue in my urethra (called a urethral stricture) from
            kidney stone removal surgery in the early 90s. As it turns out, I
            now have another stricture caused by the second biopsy and bladder
            resection surgery. I don't notice this when going to the bathroom
            but this one is so bad that the urologist could not get the scope
            into my bladder. Given that it is the same guy that caused the
            problem, he wisely decided not to force it and avoid unnecessary
            torture. He will now use the upcoming CT scan with contrast fluid to
            determine the effectiveness of the chemo treatment.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was obviously OK with not doing the cystoscopy but the new
            stricture might have an effect on my bladder reconstruction surgery.
            Depending on how narrow my urethra has become, a neobladder might
            not be the best option as I might not be able to push the urine out
            with my belly muscles. This would be a setback but a final decision
            is not required until late June. More stuff to worry about next
            month.
          </p>
          <h3>PICC Line 2.0, 23 May 2019</h3>
          <p>
            To go through chemo round four, a new
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripherally_inserted_central_catheter"
              >PICC</a
            >
            line had to be installed as two of the four chemicals are too toxic
            to put straight into a vain. Given how easy it was to install the
            first PICC line, I thought it would be a piece of cake to install
            version 2.0. Well, I was greatly mistaken.
          </p>
          <p>
            A PICC line is inserted into your upper arm and runs to near your
            heart so the chemicals can be dispersed to your entire body quickly.
            Clearly this is a risky process as you might infect your bloodstream
            or damage major arteries. As a result, the procedure is performed in
            an Operating Room (OR) under sterile conditions. The anesthetic
            (novocaine, the same stuff used by a dentist) is applied locally on
            your arm and you can follow the whole process as you are awake. The
            OR is equipped with two tools. Firstly, an ultrasound machine to see
            where the arteries run in your upper arm and to ensure the needle
            hits them. Secondly, a live low-dose x-ray machine to see how far
            the guide wire is from your heart, allowing staff to cut the PICC
            line to perfect length.
          </p>
          <p>
            So for my first PICC line, I went to the hospital where I was
            greeted by a very large male nurse who took me to the OR and got me
            ready. He was very kind and soft-spoken but did not waste any words.
            Within 5 minutes, two additional male nurses arrived. This was
            &quot;straight-from-a-horror-movie&quot; scary as the two
            individuals were also very large, unshaven and they looked like they
            just escaped from Alcatraz. These two did not waste any words either
            and went straight to work. The team was all business and the whole
            process took than less than 10 minutes. Before I knew it, I was on
            my way home. No pain, no discomfort, just a tube sticking out of my
            arm.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second PICC line was installed at a different hospital. This
            time there were no scary men in sight and the prep area as well as
            the OR were overstaffed with very friendly female nurses. They took
            almost an hour to get me ready and finally wheeled me into the OR.
            At that point I should have known this was not going to be the same
            as the first experience as the nurses (all five of them) where
            constantly talking about their private lives. As a patient, you can
            see the ultrasound and x-ray machines (if you care to look at it)
            and I quickly noticed that the first attempt with that large needle
            did not hit the vain. Neither did the second but these failures were
            covered up by all the private smalltalk. During attempts three and
            four, they decided to poke around a little which really hurt.
            Novocaine was added about 5 times. After four botched attempts, I
            pointed out that the team that successfully did the first PICC line
            used a different vain (just look at the scar on my other arm).
            Begrudgingly they accepted my point and successfully installed the
            new PICC line on the fifth attempt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below is a picture showing the immediate aftermath with a PICC line
            on top of my arm and the &quot;near misses&quot; on the side of my
            arm. This entire area turned purple and black for almost two weeks.
            Next time, I'll try to find the escapees from Alcatraz again.

          <h3>Chemo Round Four, 23 - 24 May 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Hallelujah, we're there! Here comes the last round of chemotherapy.
            As expected, the cumulative effect of multiple rounds of poison was
            noticeable especially in the tiredness department. The progression
            of round four was about the same as round three (which I chronicled
            in detail below) but I got a lot more tired than before.
          </p>
          <p>
            The big difference with the other rounds was nausea. In rounds two
            and three I suffered from &quot;traditional nausea&quot; with
            classic symptoms such as an upset stomach, queasiness, faintness,
            dry mouth and diarrhea. All of this was controllable with medication
            and looking back at it, it was manageable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The new thing in round four was what I would call &quot;mental
            nausea&quot;. For no good reason, thinking about chemotherapy,
            smelling something that reminded me of chemotherapy or seeing an
            object that I associated with chemotherapy caused an immediate and
            violent reaction. Within minutes, I would throw up followed by at
            least another ten or twenty gag reflexes to the point that my entire
            body would hurt.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first time this happened was two days before round four. I was
            about to go to bed and was cleaning my contact lenses. All of a
            sudden, I had to think about the upcoming round four and within
            minutes, I got very sick and started to vomit. The second time it
            happened was in the oncologists office where it's very hard not to
            think about chemotherapy. In total it happened about five times and
            all episodes were equally dramatic. It wasn't until two weeks after
            round four that it stopped.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I got physically stronger, it allowed me to become mentally
            stronger and have better control over these negative effects. The
            other thing that might have helped is a change in mindset. When I
            started chemo, I took the advice to listen to my body which served
            me well. When the mental nausea got really bad, I decided to reverse
            this logic. I was done with chemo and to heal faster, I thought it
            to be better for my body to listen to me. It actually worked as I
            recovered faster and the mental nausea went away.
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess the entire episode proves that the brain is a powerful
            organ. It was capable of making me physically ill based on a simple
            thought but it was also capable of accelerating my healing based on
            positive willpower. I guess the big lesson learned here is that I
            should have worked more on mental health when going through
            chemotherapy. I need to keep this in mind for the upcoming surgery.
          </p>
          <h3>Happy Birthday, 3 June 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Ten days after chemo round four was my 59th birthday. As this was
            not the best time to celebrate, I decided to officially move my
            birthday to June 16th (Father's Day). This gave my children a two
            for one deal and I would have more time to recover from chemo and
            enjoy the moment a lot more.
          </p>
          <p>
            It did however not stop my family from having a small celebration
            and find clever ways to cover up my very large head-covering bald
            spot.

          </p>
          <h3>CT Scan with Contrast, 4 June 2019</h3>
          <p>
            In order to see if the chemotherapy did its job, the oncologist had
            ordered a CT scan with two types of contrast. Firstly, I had to
            drink two pints of banana-flavored barium sulfate before going to
            the imaging center and secondly, they gave me more intravenous
            contrast fluid at the center. As you might imagine, drinking the
            barium sulfate did no go very well and I had another episode of
            mental nausea. I never told the medical staff that half the stuff
            came back out and luckily nobody yelled at me. I guess I had enough
            nuclear waste in me to take beautiful pictures.
          </p>
          <p>
            My oncologist was very happy with the scan results. The cancer did
            not spread to other parts of the body and the bladder area was
            almost clear of cancer cells. Given that the bladder will be removed
            anyway, all of this was good news and he believed the treatment had
            achieved the intended goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            The oncologist turned me back over to my urologist who will perform
            the bladder removal and reconstruction surgery. I will have to go
            back to the oncologist in September to see if the blood clots caused
            by the first PICC line are still there. If they have
            &quot;dissolved&quot;, I can stop taking the blood thinners. If not,
            I guess I'll be on my way to a cardiologist.
          </p>
          <h3>Father's Day, 16 June 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Three weeks after the last chemotherapy it was time to properly
            celebrate my birthday and Fathers Day. As this was the longest
            period without chemo treatment so far, I could definitely feel the
            difference. By getting physically and mentally stronger, I was able
            to enjoy the day and I even started to properly taste food and
            drinks again. It was a good day and I even treated myself to a beer.
            After being sober for a couple of months, I could definitely feel
            the &quot;cheap date&quot; effect.
          </p>
          <h3>Chemo and the Digestive Tract, 19 June 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout this blog, I've hinted at the effect chemo has on the
            digestive tract. Now that my aggressive MVAC chemo is over, let me
            describe the complete experience. Cancer cells are fast growing and
            chemo is designed to attack them. Other healthy fast growing cells
            in your body also become victims during chemo and my digestive tract
            was affected significantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting with my mouth. Once I started chemo, the mucous lining of
            my mouth was impacted immediately and it started to turn over
            rapidly. For over two months, my mouth felt like it was recovering
            from a mouth burn and I constantly had that slimy coating
            everywhere. Luckily I never developed mouth sores which are very
            common in chemo patients. My tongue saw the biggest effect as my
            sense of taste changed rapidly. For the first time in my life I
            started to enjoy (American) sweets as my ability to taste sugar was
            severely reduced. Bitter and sour flavors were enhanced while salt
            was harder to taste. As a result, many food items just did not taste
            right. This was not a constant as it changed during the chemo,
            driving me mad as the things I liked one week might not be so good
            the following week. On top of that, I think it was the constant
            metallic taste in my mouth that affected me the most.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mucous in my esophagus was also effected but it did not bother
            me until the end of chemo. On more than one occasion, medication
            would get stuck and I would have to eat solid foods afterwards to
            &quot;push&quot; the pills down. In the end this was not such a big
            deal as I just started to take my medication before meals.
          </p>
          <p>
            My stomach was clearly affected the most. Before chemo, I
            occasionally suffered from indigestion and acid reflux but chemo
            made this a lot worse. Luckily, over the counter antacids and acid
            reflux medication worked well, so this was also controllable. The
            biggest issue was the nausea that I already mentioned. Especially
            towards the end of the chemo treatment, feeling sick to my stomach
            and vomiting started to happen more often. The prescribed anti
            nausea medication helped a little but it could not completely bring
            it under control.
          </p>
          <p>
            My intestines were the most unpredictable during the process. For no
            reason I ever discovered, I would go from normal to constipated to
            diarrhea a few times a week without a noticeable pattern. Although
            annoying, it was manageable as long as I didn't make any
            assumptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last thing to mention is that the entire digestive tract became
            very sensitive to spices. As a person who loves spicy oriental
            foods, it was interesting to see that within one week of starting
            chemo, I had to classify black pepper (yes, black pepper) as too
            spicy for me to handle.
          </p>
          <p>
            All in all, it wasn't until about six to eight weeks after the final
            round of chemo that all the symptoms mentioned above went away.

          <h2 class="pb-2">Bladder Removal</h2>
          <h3>Decision Time, 20 June 2019</h3>
          <p>
            When I found out that my bladder cancer was at stage 2, I knew that
            my bladder had to be removed and some form of reconstruction/urinary
            diversion had to take place. Earlier in this blog I mentioned that I
            quickly came to the conclusion that I wanted a replacement bladder
            called a neobladder made out of a part of my intestines. This was a
            very comfortable notion as it gave my the sensation that my future
            life wasn't much different from my previous life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given that a hard decision was not required until now, I really
            didn't think about it much until a few weeks ago when I seriously
            looked at the pros and cons of the three possible options. Guess
            what; the decision wasn't as easy as I thought, and in the end, I
            decided to do the exact opposite of what I thought I would do.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason for this flip/flop is actually pretty simple. Initially,
            I only looked at the perceived pros of the solutions and did not
            factor in the cons nor possible risks. This created an unbalanced
            perspective that made me draw the wrong conclusions. On the other
            hand, believing this unrealistic future served me well during the
            last couple of months as it never weighed on me during those
            terrible chemo cycles.
          </p>
          <p>
            So now it was time to come back to planet earth and look at the
            whole situation realistically. For those who care, here is my
            thought process:
          </p>
          <p>
            Option 1 is the neobladder, where a segment of small bowel is used
            to create a reservoir for urine. The ureters (tubes that connect the
            kidneys to the bladder) are attached to the reservoir which is
            ultimately attached to the urethra (tube that takes urine from your
            bladder to the outside). You use the neobladder to store urine and
            you urinate either with the help of a catheter or by bearing down to
            push the urine out with abdominal pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially this sounded appealing to me as you simply had to learn to
            use different muscles to urinate. Almost business as usual. Well,
            it's not that simple. The neobladder has no nerves in it so you have
            no idea how full it is. You therefore have to urinate on the clock
            every three to four hours, day and night. Initially this has to be
            done through self-catheterization as you still need to learn the
            proper muscle technique. Given the scar tissue in my urethra caused
            by previous surgeries, this could be painful and difficult. You
            might even have to self-catheterize for the rest of your life if
            your neobladder doesn't empty properly. Finally, there is a risk of
            lifetime leakage requiring you to wear diapers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adding all of this up, the neobladder is not as appealing as I
            initially thought. Sticking something up my penis at least six times
            a day with a risk of infection, dealing with my scar tissue, living
            on a four hour clock with sleep deprivation and still face the risk
            of having to wear a diaper did not sound like business as usual, and
            I quickly lost interest in this solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Option 2 is the Indiana pouch where a part of the colon is used to
            store the urine on the inside of your body. This pouch has a channel
            brought out to the skin somewhere in the belly area that must be
            catheterized to empty the reservoir.
          </p>
          <p>
            This option is similar to the neobladder but has the advantage that
            you don't catheterize through the penis. It does however have the
            same disadvantage that you have to live on the clock and it has
            similar infection risks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Option 3 is the ileal conduit where a short segment of bowel is
            isolated with one end attached to the ureters and the other end
            brought through a small opening, or stoma, in the abdominal wall.
            You then have a pouch on the outside that collects the urine as it
            drains out of the stoma.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially I was dead set against this option as it was obviously
            going to change my appearance and I thought this option would
            require the most work. It turned out I did not inform myself
            properly and the medical urostomy ecosystem is offering some very
            clever and practical solutions that simplify this option.
          </p>
          <p>
            First of all, a urostomy pouch is very flat and unless you wear very
            skinny cloths, people are not going to see it. You can even swim
            with it and most swimwear (no, not a speedo) will cover the bag.
            Secondly, a urostomy bag needs to be replaced every two to four days
            which is not a great burden. Determining whether the bag is full is
            easy as it is on the outside of your body and emptying it is as
            simple as opening and closing a valve. Thirdly, you can cascade the
            pouch on your belly to a bigger bag so you don't even have to get up
            during the night. For long road trips or visits to the Munich
            Oktoberfest, you can cascade to a leg bag. The other 50-plussers
            will be impressed that you only have to go to the bathroom once for
            every five or more of their trips. Lastly, you never have to
            catheterize yourself and the risks of infections is significantly
            reduced.
          </p>
          <p>
            So once I got over the stigma of a pouch on my belly, and used
            quality of life to judge the pros and cons of the three options, it
            quickly became clear to me that the ileal conduit with urostomy
            pouch would be my best solution.
          </p>
          <h3>Pre-op Meeting with Surgeon, 26 June 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Today, I had my Pre-op meeting with my bladder removal surgeon. I
            discussed my reconstruction decision making with him to see if I
            covered all the angles. I think he was impressed that I had done so
            much research and confirmed all my findings. So now it's final: I'm
            going with option 3, an ileal conduit with urostomy pouch as a way
            of dealing with urine for the rest of my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            My surgeon also confirmed that he had solicited the help of a
            colleague to help him during the long procedure estimated to take
            between six and eight hours. The second surgeon is also in his early
            thirties, trained on the Da Vinci robotic system, specializes in
            urological oncology and the two have done many of these procedures
            together. I felt very comfortable being in the hands of this team.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything is a &quot;go&quot; now and I still have one month to
            strengthen, overthink the procedure and if really necessary, get
            nervous about it.
          </p>
          <h3>Another UTI, 12 July 2019</h3>
          <p>
            With less than two weeks to go until the big surgery, I'm having a
            lot of discomfort urinating again. True to form, I got another
            Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) for which I have to take antibiotics.
            On one side, it is miserable to go through this again but on the
            other side, it confirms that my current urinary plumbing is simply
            not good anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            My entire day is now focussed on (preventative) bathroom trips as I
            have little time to go to the bathroom when the urge comes. The is
            especially hard when you're about town and you're going from the
            Virgina heat into over air-conditioned spaces and back. This UTI is
            actually making me look forward to my big surgery to remove half the
            urinary tract and get a simpler life.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other good news I'm deriving from this is that my decision not
            to go with a neobladder is the right one. Having to rely on
            potentially problematic parts of the old plumbing for years to come
            does not sound appealing to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            This UTI and its timing is probably more of a blessing than a curse.
            It confirms decisions made and it makes me look forward to a time
            where planning to go to the bathroom does not dominate my life day
            and night.
          </p>
          <h3>End of an Era, 25 July 2019</h3>
          <p>
            For weeks I've been thinking about the day before the big surgery.
            On one hand it is the end of an era as I will never again urinate
            like I've done for 59 years but on the other hand, it's the start of
            a new and improved life where the inconveniences (and pain) of the
            last 12 months will be gone.
          </p>
          <p>
            The emotional person in me really struggled with this end of an era
            idea and I tried desperately not to focus on &quot;this is the last
            time I do this, or this is the last time I do that&quot;. So to deal
            with this, I tried to keep a brave and optimistic external persona
            while not letting the whole thing get to me on the inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily, my wife and children let me get away with the external
            persona so the final day before surgery wasn't too bad. We even went
            for a big &quot;lunner&quot; (a family tradition for when we eat a
            big meal between lunch and dinner). It was a very enjoyable event as
            the Virgina humidity was very low that day and we had our meal
            outside on a terrace.
          </p>
          <h3>The Big Surgery, 26 July 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Against all expectations, I slept well the night before my surgery.
            We had to get up early as I had to report to the hospital for a 5:30
            AM check-in and a 7:30 AM surgery time. The good news about the
            early start was that there was no traffic and parking was simple.
          </p>
          <p>
            I actually surprised myself a bit that morning. I was completely
            calm, no anxiety and no nervousness. To a certain extend, I was
            relieved that the big day was finally there. Once we got to the
            hospital, check-in was painless and within half an hour I was in the
            pre-op area. After a last trip to the bathroom (yes, the historic
            moment happened in the hospital), changing into one of those sexy
            hospital outfits and getting hooked up to all machines, I entered a
            final &quot;hurry up and wait&quot; period for over an hour.
            Luckily, my dear wife was allowed to be with me and I was completely
            at ease over what was about to happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            I met with both of my surgeons, my anesthesiologist and a urology
            resident of the hospital. All of them said the right things and give
            me the right vibes. I could not have asked for a better team.
            Academically brilliant, young enough to be robot assisted whizkids,
            old enough to have done it a bunch of times and not arrogant enough
            yet where they did not care about the patient anymore. I picked the
            right team.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a little delay, it was time to wheel me into the operating
            room and get the process started. Saying goodbye to my wife and
            telling her how much I loved her was the hardest part of the day.
            I'm glad they knocked me out quickly as I was really overcome by
            emotions. On my way to the operating table, I did see my friend the
            DaVinci robot and the consoles the surgeons use to control the
            machine. It looked very space age and the techno geek in me would
            have liked a tour. The last thing I remember is seeing 8:05 AM on
            the clock before I started my long sleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            My wife went home and the hospital did a remarkable job keeping her
            informed. On a regular bases, my wife got text messages and phone
            calls from an operating room nurse so she was always fully informed
            about the progress. I thought that was a remarkable service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around 3:00 PM my wife was told the surgery had been successfully
            completed and that I was in recovery. Initially, we were told that
            the first recovery would be in an intensive care unit but
            apparently, the surgery went so well that this was not required. I
            had suffered minimal blood loss, and my respiratory system and heart
            function were completely stable during and after surgery.
          </p>
          <p>
            My wife was also called by my surgeon who was very positive about
            how the procedure went. It took a little longer than expected but he
            was very satisfied. Those surgery days have to be grueling for these
            guys as they have to be in the hospital 2 hours before, perform a 7
            hour surgery without a break and then have to do the post-op. I'm
            very impressed.
          </p>
          <p>

              alt="room"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            I regained consciousness around 5:00 PM and felt completely
            comfortable. No pain, no nausea, just very tired and sleepy. I
            assume they put a bunch of strong pain killers in me but I was
            feeling really good. It took a while before they figured out my
            hospital room but eventually, I was moved to my room at 7:00 PM.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"

              alt="before/after"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't remember much of that evening but seeing my darling wife who
            was waiting in my room made my day. Everybody has a guardian angel
            in their life and she is certainly mine.
          </p>
          <h3>Recovery in the Hospital, 26 July 2019</h3>
          <p>
            The day after the surgery started pretty good. I was comfortable,
            the discomfort was limited and early indications were that I was on
            track for a speedy recovery. I was quickly moved from a water only
            to a liquid food diet and the visit by my wife and kids was great.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/cancer/IMG_0806.jpg"
              alt="family visit"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the &quot;fun&quot; parts was that I was hooked to a patient
            controlled morphine dispenser. Every time I felt discomfort, I could
            press a button and 30 seconds later I was in a very happy place. The
            whole thing was controlled by a computer that ensured I could not
            overdose. So for most of the day I was on a different planet.
          </p>
          <p>
            That evening I had my second liquid meal and all of a sudden I
            started to get terrible nausea that lasted for days. The first
            reaction of the hospital was to treat the symptoms. If you are
            nauseated, you get anti nausea medication. That did not improve the
            situation and I believe it actually made it worse. They also decided
            to put me back on a water only diet.
          </p>
          <p>
            For 48 hours I was miserable. Nobody knew what was going on and the
            hospital departments were blaming each other. Urology said it was a
            side effect of anesthetics, The anesthesiology group blamed the
            antibiotics and others blamed the magnesium supplements or the pain
            killers. What really frustrated me was that everybody had an answer
            for the symptoms but nobody wanted to look for the root cause.
          </p>
          <p>
            The analyst in me got really upset and decided that I would do the
            root cause analysis myself by eliminating medications. First I
            stopped using the morphine and all other pain medications. I ended
            up with some discomfort but it was manageable. Secondly I refused
            medications that were treating side effects. In the end, I
            discovered that the culprit was the medication to restart my
            intestines.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my surgery, a part of my intestines were used for the new
            urinary diversion. Apparently your intestinal system &quot;falls
            asleep&quot; after this kind of surgery and it needs something to
            kickstart it again. Once they changed that medication, the nausea
            went away and I ended three days of throwing up.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the end I was on a water only diet for five days and lost eight
            pounds. With the new medication, my intestinal function started
            quickly and I was moved to real food. Recovery accelerated quickly
            and after a torturous six days, I was released and could start my
            recovery at home.
          </p>
          <h3>Coming Home, 1 August 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Coming home was fantastic. I was clearly weakened by the surgery and
            the starvation diet but I was euphoric to be done with it all. My
            first full day home I had some visitors and they were very impressed
            that I could move around and have a conversation for a while.
          </p>
          <p>
            With perfect hindsight, it must have been the euphoria and
            adrenaline that got me through the first day since the following
            days were a lot harder and I slowly started to deteriorate. I became
            more tired and was constantly cold. I had little to no appetite and
            it was a struggle to focus on anything. Within a few days I was a TV
            watching zombie again that did not absorb anything and I assume I
            was a concern to my family.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally after a few days I decided to measure my temperature and it
            was climbing quickly. Eventually it hit 102 Fahrenheit and we called
            the urologist. As always, these things happen after hours but I got
            a callback quickly. The doctor on call happened to be the person who
            performed my first biopsy and he was very helpful. He recommended I
            go to the emergency room in the hospital where my surgery was
            performed and get some blood work done. The reason he recommended
            that hospital is that it's the only one in the area where all
            medical disciplines are in the building 24/7.

          <h3>Back to the Hospital, 7 August 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Well, the simple trip to the hospital to get some blood work done
            quickly changed to hospitalization. My white blood cell count was
            out of control indicating some massive infection. Not knowing what
            kind it was, they did a urine and blood culture to detect the type
            and loaded me up with a wide reaching palette of antibiotics.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/cancer/IMG_0810.jpg"
              alt="ER"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            My body did not take these antibiotics very kindly and
            nausea/vomiting started almost immediately. My mental state went
            downhill quickly as the memories from the first hospitalization were
            still very fresh. It was frustrating, especially since the hospital
            did not have a room ready. I told my wife to go home (waiting was
            torture for her as well) and they finally transferred me from the
            emergency room to a hospital bed at 3:00 AM.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given that they could not rule out the need for emergency surgery, I
            was once again put on a water only diet. Another flashback I could
            have done without.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the second day they continued the hunt for the infection source
            and finally they found that I had a nasty bacterial infection in my
            intestines called
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clostridioides_difficile_infection"
              >Clostridium difficile</a
            >
            or C. Diff for short. This is some really nasty stuff and I was put
            in isolation and on some very strong antibiotics. Isolation in this
            case meant that I could not leave my hospital room and everybody
            coming into my room had to wear a hazmat gown and gloves (including
            all visitors). Everything brought into the room had to stay there or
            be wiped off with chlorine after leaving the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/cancer/IMG_0815.jpg"
              alt="Nicole's visit"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            The cocktail of antibiotics did a real number on me as it completely
            destroyed all good bacteria and I was nauseated for a number of
            days. I hit a really deep low one night and I even got scared. Here
            I was sick to my stomach with a raging fever, high white blood cell
            count and feeling more miserable than at any other point during this
            journey. Was I going to be one of those statistics that did well
            during the original surgery but would later succumb to post-op
            complications? It was a lonely night and it took every ounce of
            remaining energy to talk some sense into myself. Clearly if things
            were as bad as I thought, I would be on an intensive care unit.
            Finally I calmed down and managed to get some sleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            I again got upset with the medical staff as they were keeping me in
            the dark as to what the plan was. Did they even have one or did they
            think I was too stupid to understand? All of this happened on a
            weekend were hospitals operate in slow motion and the people on duty
            don't want to be there. The best example was the urologist on duty
            that weekend. If I had not chosen to go with the robotic assisted
            surgery, this doctor would have been my surgeon. Initially I was
            happy with him showing up as he had done the most cystectomies in
            the region. My opinion changed quickly however as he was arrogant,
            never listened to me and constantly interrupted me. He never
            answered my questions and it was clear he did not want to be there.
            At one point I thought he might even be vindictive as I did not pick
            him as my surgeon and went with a younger, less experienced team.
            For what it's worth, at least he confirmed I did the right thing. I
            could not imagine having him as my physician.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily on Monday morning, the stars aligned as the urology resident
            on duty was the same lady who observed my surgery and was very
            helpful during my first hospital stay. My surgeon had also come back
            from a week of vacation and the two finally answered my questions
            and came up with a plan. To my great surprise they released me from
            the hospital that day as my vital signs and white blood cell count
            were back to normal. The &quot;only&quot; antibiotic I was taking
            was oral so I could continue that at home and my diarrhea was under
            control. The news made this grown man cry and I could see light at
            the end of the tunnel again. I did however lose another five pounds
            in the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            So one last point on isolation. Despite all the precautions I
            mentioned before, the food delivery staff never suited up before
            coming into my room and even worse, I don't think they took any
            precautions with my tray (which I clearly touched) when they picked
            it up. And they are the people that literally go to every hospital
            bed. What a loophole. It was almost as comical as the housekeeping
            staff that did suit up but only cleaned around objects. My bed side
            table for instance would only be cleaned were open spaces were
            visible. Not a single object on the table was lifted in the cleaning
            process. What a joke. No wonder hospitals are bacterial exchange
            programs and I'm assuming I picked up my bacteria during my first
            hospital stay.
          </p>
          <h3>The Effect of Antibiotics, 20 August 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Most of us have seen a few rounds of antibiotics in our lives and I
            can not recall ever feeling an effect or suffering side effects. I
            was therefore completely shocked how much I suffered during the
            antibiotic treatment for this C. Diff infection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dry mouth, out of whack taste buds, metallic taste in my mouth,
            upset stomach, nausea, vomiting, lack of appetite, zero energy, fast
            weight loss and poor blood circulation in toes and fingers. It was
            terrible and I must say that the side effects of these antibiotics
            were worse than those of chemotherapy.
          </p>
          <p>
            After I came home, I had to take the antibiotics for another eight
            days and it was a struggle. On two occasions just taking the pill
            would cause vomiting and in the end I lost another ten pounds. My
            total weight loss since the morning of surgery was 22 pounds (over a
            3 week period). No wonder I'm feeling weak.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast to the chemotherapy however, my body recovered quickly
            and three day after taking the last antibiotics, I could feel a
            turnaround. Weight loss had stopped and I had regained some
            appetite. My taste buds are not back to normal yet but hopefully
            that won't be too long.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think I can honestly say that this bacterial infection and the
            antibiotic treatment were the hardest part of my journey so far. For
            it to come at a time that I thought I was climbing my way out of
            hell, it was soul destroying to be sent straight back.
          </p>
          <h3>Finally Some Good News, 21 August 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Today I met with my surgeon to remove my stents and to hear the
            results of my biopsies. Stent removal was a non-event and the biopsy
            results were extremely positive.
          </p>
          <p>
            All (dead) cancer cells were contained in the badder and the cancer
            had not spread into my prostate. Even better news was that the 21
            lymph nodes removed during surgery were totally clean. Based on the
            CT scan, they already thought this but until they do a biopsy of the
            parts removed, they can't know for sure.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was a major relief as my body is now cancer free after surgery
            even though nobody will say this. I can now start the real journey
            to recovery and one day call myself a cancer survivor.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've seen the highway to hell, I've been on the highway through hell
            and I even made a U-turn back to hell. I'm now looking forward to
            continuing my journey on the highway out of hell and never return.
          </p>
          <h3>Not so Fast, 6 September 2019</h3>
          <p>
            Today, I visited the oncologist who explained that my urologist was
            a little too optimistic. My biopsy had revealed that some cancer
            cells made it into the blood vessel bundles that were attached to
            the bladder although there was no evidence that they made it into
            the blood stream or any other part of my body. I now have to do a CT
            scan every three months for two years to ensure nothing pops up.
          </p>
          <h3>Infection Number 2, 12 November 2019</h3>
          <p>
            I ended up with a massive infection that required hospitalization.
            This time it was a kidney infection caused by a narrowing in my left
            ureter which caused my kidney to pool urine. My body responded
            quickly to the antibiotics and I recovered within a few days.
            Unfortunately, tests proved that my kidney function was not right
            and that this urethral stricture would have to be dealt with as it
            was likely to cause future infections.
          </p>
          <h3>Family Emergency, Late November 2019</h3>
          <p>
            My mother-in-law has been in poor health for the last couple of
            months and my wife and I had decided to go to the Netherlands in
            December to see her one more time. Given that I was a ticking time
            bomb for another infection, I agreed with my urologist that I would
            take antibiotics with me and postpone surgery to fix my ureter until
            after the trip.
          </p>
          <h3>Death in the Family, December 2019</h3>
          <p>
            By the time we got to the Netherlands, my mother-in-law had
            deteriorated so badly that she was now in a hospice. We decided to
            extend our trip for one week and she died in my wife’s arms during
            the night when she had the watch. We were able to attend the funeral
            and came back on Christmas Eve. My body behaved perfectly and we
            couldn’t have scripted this sad event any better. When there’s an
            ocean between you and your parents, it is hard with end-of-life
            events. Two of our parents died of catastrophic events (one a
            massive heart attach and the other of a stroke), one died of
            pancreatic cancer and the last of old age. We were very grateful
            that we could be there for at least one of them.
          </p>
          <h3>Six Month CT scan, 2 January 2020</h3>
          <p>
            My regular oncology CT scan was clean so at least that news was
            good.
          </p>
          <h3>Infection Number 3, 10 January 2020 ==</h3>
          <p>
            My luck ran out and I was once again hospitalized for a kidney
            infection. This time my fever was 104 with a heart rate of 160 at
            rest when I walked into the Emergency Room and I almost ended up on
            the cardiology department. Antibiotics worked well again but this
            time they also installed a nephrostomy tube to better drain my left
            kidney.
          </p>
          <p>
            A
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrostomy"
              >nephrostomy tube</a
            >
            is a catheter (a thin tube). It is put in through your skin and into
            your kidney to drain your urine. Typically you need a nephrostomy
            tube when something is blocking your normal flow of urine from your
            kidney. The bad part is that this tube empties into another bag so I
            ended up with two bags for a while.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily, the radiologist that installed the nephrostomy tube saw my
            discomfort and smithed the regular nephrostomy to a retrograde
            nephrostomy. That type drains internally and basically because like
            a “stent” between the kidney and the bladder (in my case the ileal
            conduit). This allowed to bypass the stricture and lower the risk of
            infection.
          </p>
          <h3>Trying to fix the Stricture, 24 Jan 2020</h3>
          <p>
            My urologist went in to try and fix my ureter with a laser scarring
            and angioplasty-like balloon technique to open up my ureter. This
            procedure has a low chance of success but it is not invasive so we
            agreed it should be tried before more drastic surgery was pursued.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was very nervous about what he found and I think he believed the
            narrowing of the ureter was caused by escaped cancer. Luckily, the
            biopsy revealed that this was not the case so it was “just” a
            chronic infection caused by that stricture.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, my retrograde nephrostomy was removed and replaced
            by a “wider” stent to keep the ureter open while the scared tissue
            healed. In the end, I had no pain and there was no noticeable side
            effects.
          </p>
          <h3>Infection number 4, 5 March 2020</h3>
          <p>
            I had another UTI (luckily no hospitalization required this time)
            but the CT scan showed that the surgery to fix the stricture had not
            worked. They now have to go back in and cut the bad piece out. Step
            one will be another temporary nephrostomy tube and step two full be
            major surgery to fix the ureter.
          </p>
          <p>
            The nephrostomy tube was the regular type with a tube sticking out
            of your back but they added the retrograde part so it would drain
            internally. This way I did not require a second bag but I had a tube
            with port sicking out of my back.
          </p>
          <h3>Oncology CT Scan, 3 April 2020</h3>
          <p>
            COVID-19 is really disrupting routine medical procedures. Luckily,
            emergency procedures and treatment for cancer patients are still
            allowed so I could do my regular CT body scan. It came back negative
            so fingers crossed, it looks like the cancer is gone (for now).
          </p>
          <p>
            My Oncologist explained that I will keep doing these scans regularly
            for two years after which they are done annually. After two years,
            there is a 95% probability that the cancer will not return.
          </p>
          <h3>The waiting Game, 6 April 2020</h3>
          <p>
            I now know that the ureteral stricture has to be removed and this
            will be major surgery. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 restrictions,
            this procedure can’t be performed and I will have to wait until the
            government allows these procedures to be restarted.
          </p>
          <p>
            My urologist tells me that once they start back up, I will be
            priority 2 out of 3 as the people who need cancer removal will have
            to go first. Based on current projections, it’s likely June before
            they start and my turn will not be before July.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the only choice I have right now is to keep nephrostomy tubes to
            minimize the chance of infections. These tubes have to be replaces
            on a regular basis and even that is hard to schedule. Luckily my
            radiologist is very good at using the words emergency and life
            threatening so he was able to get me in for a replacement.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was a remarkable experience since I never saw another patient
            at the hospital that day. Parking lot and all waiting rooms were
            completely empty so it all went very fast. I guess there are
            positive side effect to COVID-19. As this was outpatient, I’ve was
            back home on opioids in no time.
          </p>
          <h3>Swelling around my Nephrostomy Tube, 6 May 2020</h3>
          <p>
            The exit wound of my nephrostomy tube started to look angry. After
            texting a picture to my urologist, he did not want this to develop
            into another infection so he contacted the radiologist to have the
            tube replaced. Yet again, they cleverly used terms like urgent and
            life threatening to convince the hospital to allow the procedure
            while under COVID-19 lockdown.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              class="rounded img-fluid"
              src="img/cancer/IMG_0429.jpg"
              alt="nephrostomy tube"
            />
          </p>
          <p>
            The procedure went well and it was over in 30 minutes. Again the
            hospital was a ghost town and I never saw another patient. The other
            good thing was that the radiologist installed a retrograde
            nephrostomy tube which is fully internal. No more exist wounds on my
            back as this tube (stent) has to stay there until I can finally
            schedule my surgery.
          </p>
          <h3>Finally, It can be Scheduled, 19 June 2020</h3>
          <p>
            Today, I got the phone call from the urology group that it’s finally
            my turn to get scheduled for major surgery to fix my ureter by
            cutting out the bad part. Surgery is scheduled for August 12th and
            it will take 4 to 5 hours (ouch).
          </p>
          <p>
            The same surgeons that performed the first surgery will conduct this
            one as well and again they’ll be assisted by the Da Vinci robot. I’m
            really looking forward to get this done and restart a normal life.
          </p>
          <h3>Resignation, 30 June 2020</h3>
          <p>
            After an 18 month ordeal where I’ve tried a professional come back
            at least 5 times, I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s time for me
            to make some serious life changes and focus on the more important
            things.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you're away from a workplace for this long, many things happen
            and you start to feel like an outsider. Things you’ve created have
            been replaced, procedures have become more bureaucratic and most
            importantly, tribal alliances have morphed. For a while, I was ready
            to address the large number of issues I faced but eventually I came
            to the conclusion that I no longer had the energy to set it all
            straight again.
          </p>
          <p>
            So i’ve decided to retire on December 31st after a 40 year career in
            a very complex international environment. By the time all my medical
            issues are solved, I’ve undergone a two year journey and I now want
            to focus on my family and myself.

          <h3>Major Surgery Number 2, 12 August 2020</h3>
          <p>
            Today it is finally time and they will hopefully fix my ureter once
            and for all. It will be a 4 to 5 hour surgery by two surgeons
            assisted by my friend Da Vinci, the robot.
          </p>
          <p>
            It all went very well and they removed a small portion of my ureter
            (about 1 cm) and made a new connection to my ileal conduit. In the
            end, I only spent one night in the hospital as they don’t want
            patients there for too long due to COVID-19 fears. If your vital
            signs are good and they see no life threatening issues, you’re out
            of there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Personally, I think I went home too soon and I had serious pain for
            2 weeks. One of the robot entry wounds got infected but it luckily
            got under control quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you now look at my belly, I look like someone who survived a
            grenade blast. After two rounds of robot surgery and a number of
            nephrostomy tubes, I have 16 beautiful scares in a random pattern. I
            have decided that I’ll make up a number of war stories to tell
            people who ask questions.
          </p>
          <h3>Post Surgery Results, 13 September 2020</h3>
          <p>
            My surgeon had send in the piece of ureter he removed for a
            pathological exam and luckily it showed no signs of cancer. This
            really good news but what caused that stricture?
          </p>
          <p>
            In my mind, it is very likely that something went wrong during the
            healing process after the bladder removed surgery and it caused the
            stricture. When I was hospitalized for my C. Diff infection, 2 weeks
            after my bladder removal, there was a lot of blood in my urine for a
            few days and it’s likely something went wrong then and there. I will
            probably never know what the cause was which is OK with me (as long
            as it doesn’t come back).
          </p>
          <p>
            The other good news is that an ultrasound of my left urinary tract
            showed that I now have normal flow and the new connection looks very
            good. Let’s hope this problem is now solved and I don’t have to deal
            with these infections anymore.
          </p>
          <h3>Last day of Employment, 31 December 2020</h3>
          <p>
            If you had asked my 5 years ago when I would retire, I would have
            answered: &quot;when they force me to&quot; which in my case would
            be June 2025. Now to be fair, if you have asked me at the same time
            if I could ever be a cancer patient, if would have told you that the
            probability was low given my family history. Heart decease on the
            other hand could be a bigger problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, things went differently and after a two year medical journey
            that included a one year battle with cancer and an unfortunate
            second year fighting infections, going back to work was not high on
            my list. Time had moved on and the teams and projects I was managing
            took turns different from what I thought was wise.
          </p>
          <p>
            So today is my last day of employment and I'll start retirement
            tomorrow. I have to emit that I'm emotional about this as I've
            worked in an international environment with wonderful people for 40
            years straight. I will not miss the inevitable bureaucracy but I
            will miss the people.
          </p>
          <h3>CT Scan Results, 4 Jan 2021</h3>
          <p>
            I did another routine CT scan with contrast fluid on December 30th.
            Today I got the results and everything is looking good. This is a
            great start to retirement. My next CT scan will be in May.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing I'm starting to work on now is physical strength. Two
            years of limited physical activity have taken their toll and I'm out
            of breath quickly. So now that I have time on my hands, I've started
            to go for a daily 3 mile walk which is enjoyable and even mentally
            therapeutic.
          </p>
          <h3>COVID-19 Vaccinations, 15 Feb 2021</h3>
          <p>
            During my last visit to the Urologist and Oncologist, I asked both
            if my COVID-19 risk levels were elevated. Both of them told me
            &quot;NO&quot; as I have no active cancer and I'm not
            immunocompromised. So when the time came to register myself with the
            State of Virginia, I answered those questions honestly and I
            therefore did not yet qualify for the vaccine. I was simply going to
            have to wait my turn.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the following months, this started to bug me as more and more
            people around me got vaccinated and most of them were very healthy.
            Marathon runners who smoked once in a while, people who had cancer a
            decade ago, people with slight overweight and so on. I started to
            feel frustrated about a poorly managed system where people could
            easily be &quot;economical with the truth&quot;.
          </p>
          <p>
            I therefore concluded that I had three problems: I was too young,
            too healthy and too honest. On top of that, the State of Virginia
            did not let you change your vaccine registration. Back to waiting my
            turn and hunker down in the process.
          </p>
          <h3>Change in COVID Vaccine Rules - 5 March 2021</h3>
          <p>
            I was notified today that the State of Virginia had changed its
            vaccine eligibility rules and I was now able to go back and update
            my information. I ticked the cancer box that I left unmarked
            initially. I fully accepted the criteria laid out by my Urologist
            and Oncologist but on the other hand, neither of them will tell me
            I'm cancer free or that my cancer is in remission (I assume that is
            for legal reasons). We'll, if I had cancer and I'm not cancer free,
            I see no reason not to tick the cancer box especially since the
            State of Virginia has no description on what the single word
            (cancer) means in this context.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also ticked the overweight box since it now had a link to a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"
              >Body Mass Index (BMI)</a
            >
            of 25. This box alone will make 80% of all Virginians qualify for
            the vaccine.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was eventually able to schedule my vaccinations for March 23rd and
            April 13th. I had done a lot of research on the available vaccines
            and I was able to get the number one on my list: Pfizer-BioNTech.
          </p>
          <h3>Trying a Little too Hard to Get Fit - 11 April 2021</h3>
          <p>
            Well, I overdid it again. In an attempt to quickly improve my
            physical strength, I went too far, too fast and I hurt my
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroneus_longus"
              >Peroneus Longus</a
            >
            and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroneus_brevis"
              >Peroneus Brevis</a
            >
            muscles in my lower right leg. Luckily, I did not cause too much
            damage and physical therapy alone will probably do the trick. The
            good news about this is that at least they'll teach me the right way
            to warm up before I do something crazy next time.

          <h3>My Daughter's College Graduation - 7 May 2021</h3>
          <p>
            Two years ago I was undergoing chemotherapy and I attended my son's
            college graduation between rounds three and four. On one side, it
            was a victory dance as cancer couldn't stop my from attending and
            being proud. On the other side, the chemo had taken its toll and
            thoughts about mortality were dominating the days surrounding the
            graduation (you can about it above in the 18 May 2019 entry).
          </p>
          <p>
            It's now two years later, I'm doing a lot better and I was able to
            attend my daughter's graduation. It felt great but I have to admit
            that I was overcome by emotion when her name was called. Two years
            ago, I wasn't sure if I would see this moment. Well, I did and I'm
            proud of my daughter who's struggled with
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_processing_disorder"
              >Auditory Procession Disorder</a
            >
            her entire life. Not only did she obtain her Bachelors of Science in
            Communications, she was also accepted into three graduate schools.
            That girl will be going places and I couldn't be more proud of her.
