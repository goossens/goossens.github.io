![Intel 4004](class:float-right:rounded:p-2:img/Intel4004.jpg)
Electronics and software engineering have played a major role in my
life since I was about 12 years old. In my [biography](#biograpy), you
can read how it all got started. After I got
[Intel's 4004 chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004) to work
in a homemade "computer", I quickly moved to bigger and better. After all,
there is only so much so can do with a 4-bit computer that only has
40 bytes of memory and no way to persistently store something beyond
keeping the CPU backed up with battery power.

![Tandy TRS-80](class:float-left:rounded:p-2:img/TRS-80.jpg)
In my late teens and early twenties, I quickly move to a
[Tandy (Radio Shack) TRS-80 Model I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80)
using a cassette player for program and data storage and later adding a
5-inch floppy drive. From there, I moved to a
[Bondwell 12](http://www.z80.eu/bondwell.html) "luggable"
all-in-one system,
[Z80 CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80), 64KB of memorry,
a build-in monitor and 2 floppy drives. I closed the eighties by owning
my first 16-bit, 1 megabyte computer, the
[Atari 520ST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST) with a
Motorola 68000 chip, bitmap color display and 3.5" floppy drive. If I had
kept all those computers, I could have started a small museum.

Along the way, I wrote software for all of those systems. I wrote
simple games, developed my own operating system based on
[XINU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinu) (which is a fantastic
recursive acronym meaning Xinu Is Not UNIX), wrote a database system
and commercially developed software for a German Prefab Housing
company.

As you can also see in my [biography](#biograpy), I started my professional
career as a system software developer/analyst. I stayed in that field
my entire professional life but as I moved up the ladder, I got further
and further away from coding and at the end, I spent more time in
international politics than in software development, innovation or
engineering.

![Macintosh Plus](class:float-right:rounded:p-2:img/MacintoshPlus.jpg)
Luckily for me, I could afford a Macintosh in the early 90s and have
owned almost every model since the
[Macintosh Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Plus).
This allowed me to continue to write software for fun or to be used
in my music hobby. You can read about this later

Now that I'm retired, I'll be more active again as a programmer.
The first thing I'm dusting off is a programming language I developed
in the early 90s. I originally developed a simple scripting language
for work that is still in use today. For fun, I made it fully
Object-Oriented and throughout the years, I used it to learn new
techniques and I moved the implementation from Standard C to C++17.
[ObjectTalk](https://github.com/goossens/ObjectTalk) is now Open Source
so everybody can play with it. I recognize that the world doesn't need
another language but this has helped me understand language, compiler
and virtual machine design and implementation. If anybody else can learn
from this, great.

I've also started to find easier ways to build static web sites like
this one. Most platforms were too heavy for me so I quickly created
the [Pugger](https://github.com/goossens/Pugger) tool. Nothing spectacular
but it meets my simple needs.

I'll also be making some of my music-related software available.
The first will be a package called "Conductor" that takes to output
of a MIDI device (in my case, my drum kit) and control a light show
based on recognized patterns and song recipes.
