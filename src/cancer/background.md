Throughout my life, I've had kidney stones (about 9, lost count) and every
few years I went through a very painful ordeal. As a result, I have been
going to a urologist every year for regular checkups and even more
frequently when stone symptoms popped up. I have not knowingly passed a
stone in the last 5 years although I had symptoms on multiple occasions.

For me, kidney stone pain is either the classic sharp pain in the back,
discomfort in the lower tummy or a radiating pain in my upper legs or
groin. Another feature of kidney stone pain is that it could be digital;
one minute there's extreme pain with vomiting, and the next it's completely
gone. Most of my symptoms over the last couple of years were like that.

In 2015, I thought I had another stone (sharp pain and a little blood in my
urine). X-rays were inconclusive (small stones don't always show well) but a
CT scan with contrast fluid showed that I had no stones. The CT scan did
however show that I had a "partially contracted bladder that is grossly
unremarkable" (not making this up, this was in the report of the
radiologist). As the symptoms went away, it was assumed that the stone
had passed before the scan without me feeling it.

Christmas 2017 I had another episode. Back to the urologist but the
outcome was the same.

With the hindsight of a
[Monday morning quarterback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias),
it is likely that my bladder cancer has been around for a while but it was
always misinterpreted as another stone by me and my urologists.

### Christmas 2018

In November/December 2018, "the kidney stone pain" came back but this time
the symptoms were a little different. The pain was the same, there was no
visible blood but I had rapidly increased my daytime trips to the bathroom
from 4 to about 10. Again the urologist couldn't find anything and ordered
another CT scan.

Before I even had the results, I became incontinent during the night and my
night time bathroom excursions went from never to about 8 times. As a
result, I no longer hit deep sleep and felt like I was shooting a jet lag
version of the movie Groundhog Day. It did not take long to find out that
sleep deprivation is debilitating and often used as a form of torture.

The CT scan again showed no signs of stones so this time we had to look for
something else.

### Prostatitis, Jan 2019

The first guess of my urologist was a
[Urinary tract infection (UTI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection) or
[bacterial prostatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostatitis).
My urine contained some bacteria but not clinically significant. They put
me on 6 weeks of antibiotics but the symptoms got worse. The next diagnosis
was non-bacterial prostatitis. The problem with this is that it has no
known cause, there is no test for it and there is no cure. This was really
frustrating as control freaks like me don't deal well with the "unknown
unknown". I think I'm heading for depression. Prostate cancer was ruled
out as my PSA levels were extremely low and my full bloodwork was clean.

My urologist suggested that we should do a
[cystoscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystoscopy) but recommended to
wait a few weeks as my prostate was very tender. I told him I understood
the possible pain but I would rather know the state of my bladder and have
some pain than to deal with this debilitating uncertainty.

Well, I did that painful cystoscopy a few days later and it turned out
that the inside of my bladder contained a few bumps. The first words out
of my urologist's mouth were: "*that's not cancer!*". Apparently
[bladder cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_cancer) starts in
the bladder liner and grows into the bladder space like a cauliflower that
turns angry red and starts to bleed. This is typically how it's detected.
The liner over my bladder's bumps looked the same as the rest of the liner.
The doctor was puzzled as he had never seen this in over 30 years. He
ordered a CT scan with contrast and recommended a biopsy just to make sure.
