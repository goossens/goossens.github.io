### Major Surgery Number 2, 12 August 2020

Today it is finally time and they will hopefully fix my ureter once and for
all. It will be a 4 to 5 hour surgery by two surgeons assisted by my friend
Da Vinci, the robot.

It all went very well and they removed a small portion of my ureter
(about 1 cm) and made a new connection to my ileal conduit. In the end, I
only spent one night in the hospital as they don’t want patients there for
too long due to COVID-19 fears. If your vital signs are good and they see
no life threatening issues, you’re out of there.

Personally, I think I went home too soon and I had serious pain for 2 weeks.
One of the robot entry wounds got infected but it luckily got under control
quickly.

If you now look at my belly, I look like someone who survived a grenade
blast. After two rounds of robot surgery and a number of nephrostomy tubes,
I have 16 beautiful scares in a random pattern. I have decided that I’ll
make up a number of war stories to tell people who ask questions.

### Post Surgery Results, 13 September 2020

My surgeon had send in the piece of ureter he removed for a pathological
exam and luckily it showed no signs of cancer. This really good news but
what caused that stricture?

In my mind, it is very likely that something went wrong during the healing
process after the bladder removed surgery and it caused the stricture.
When I was hospitalized for my C. Diff infection, 2 weeks after my bladder
removal, there was a lot of blood in my urine for a few days and it’s
likely something went wrong then and there. I will probably never know
what the cause was which is OK with me (as long as it doesn’t come back).

The other good news is that an ultrasound of my left urinary tract showed
that I now have normal flow and the new connection looks very good. Let’s
hope this problem is now solved and I don’t have to deal with these
infections anymore.

### Last day of Employment, 31 December 2020

If you had asked my 5 years ago when I would retire, I would have answered:
"when they force me to" which in my case would be June 2025. Now to be
fair, if you have asked me at the same time if I could ever be a cancer
patient, if would have told you that the probability was low given my
family history. Heart decease on the other hand could be a bigger problem.

Well, things went differently and after a two year medical journey that
included a one year battle with cancer and an unfortunate second year
fighting infections, going back to work was not high on my list. Time
had moved on and the teams and projects I was managing took turns
different from what I thought was wise.

So today is my last day of employment and I'll start retirement
tomorrow. I have to emit that I'm emotional about this as I've worked
in an international environment with wonderful people for 40 years
straight. I will not miss the inevitable bureaucracy but I will miss
the people.

### CT Scan Results, 4 Jan 2021

I did another routine CT scan with contrast fluid on December 30th. Today
I got the results and everything is looking good. This is a great start to
retirement. My next CT scan will be in May.

One thing I'm starting to work on now is physical strength. Two years of
limited physical activity have taken their toll and I'm out of breath
quickly. So now that I have time on my hands, I've started to go for
a daily 3 mile walk which is enjoyable and even mentally therapeutic.

### COVID-19 Vaccinations, 15 Feb 2021

During my last visit to the Urologist and Oncologist, I asked both
if my COVID-19 risk levels were elevated. Both of them told me "NO" as
I have no active cancer and I'm not immunocompromised. So when the
time came to register myself with the State of Virginia, I answered those
questions honestly and I therefore did not yet qualify for the vaccine.
I was simply going to have to wait my turn.

In the following months, this started to bug me as more and more people
around me got vaccinated and most of them were very healthy.
Marathon runners who smoked once in a while, people who had cancer
a decade ago, people with slight overweight and so on. I started to
feel frustrated about a poorly managed system where people could
easily be "economical with the truth".

I therefore concluded that I had three problems: I was too young, too
healthy and too honest. On top of that, the State of Virginia did not let
you change your vaccine registration. Back to waiting my turn and hunker
down in the process.

### Change in COVID Vaccine Rules - 5 March 2021

I was notified today that the State of Virginia had changed its
vaccine eligibility rules and I was now able to go back and update
my information. I ticked the cancer box that I left unmarked initially.
I fully accepted the criteria laid out by my Urologist and Oncologist
but on the other hand, neither of them will tell me I'm cancer free or
that my cancer is in remission (I assume that is for legal reasons).
We'll, if I had cancer and I'm not cancer free, I see no reason not to
tick the cancer box especially since the State of Virginia has no
description on what the single word (cancer) means in this context.

I also ticked the overweight box since it now had a link to a
[Body Mass Index (BMI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index)
of 25. This box alone will make 80% of all Virginians qualify for the
vaccine.

I was eventually able to schedule my vaccinations for March 23rd and
April 13th. I had done a lot of research on the available vaccines
and I was able to get the number one on my list: Pfizer-BioNTech.

### Trying a Little too Hard to Get Fit - 11 April 2021

Well, I overdid it again. In an attempt to quickly improve my physical
strength, I went too far, too fast and I hurt my
[Peroneus Longus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroneus_longus) and
[Peroneus Brevis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peroneus_brevis) muscles
in my lower right leg. Luckily, I did not cause too much damage and
physical therapy alone will probably do the trick. The good news about
this is that at least they'll teach me the right way to warm up before
I do something crazy next time.
