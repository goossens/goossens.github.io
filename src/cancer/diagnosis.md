### Biopsy Number One, 14 Feb 2019

Getting appointments was hard at this point since waiting times were weeks
to months. Luckily my urologist is the father of my daughter's Kindergarten
and Elementary School friend. He has been to our house dropping off or
picking up his daughter several times and as luck might have it, both of our
daughters are now in the same university. He put in the extra effort and cut
through the ridiculous medical bureaucracy. I got a biopsy scheduled within
a week, performed by one of his urology friends (my urologist was not
available as he had to go to some convention).

The biopsy however was extremely painful as they damaged my urethra. Many
years ago, I had a kidney stone surgically removed and it took two four-hour
sessions to get the darn thing out. They damaged my urethra badly and it caused a
[urethral stricture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethral_stricture).
This was never an issue for me before but during the biopsy, they couldn't
get the surgical tube through my urethra and probably used a little force.
Bottom line: I was in extreme pain and pied blood for days. The pain was so
extreme that even opioids couldn't mask it. The most interesting thing about
the biopsy was that my second urologist told me that he "*did not think it
was cancer*"". But he had to admit he had never seen something like this
either.

### CT Scan with Contrast Fluid, 20 Feb 2019

One week later I got the results of the CT scan. It concluded that my
bladder wall was thickened. It was an "*inflammation not cancerous*"". The
scan also confirmed that the rest of the lower body was in good shape. From
the bottom of my stomach down, all organs were good and the lower lymph
nodes were clean.

### The Day You Get the Call, 27 Feb 2019

Your entire life you think about the medial issues you might face later in
life. In my case, there is no known cancer in my family with the
exception of a chain-smoking cousin. Both of my parents and two grandparents
however died of diabetes related heart failure. I therefore naively assumed
I did not have to worry much about cancer but should focus on heart health
and watch my blood sugar.

A couple of hours before I had an appointment with my original urologist
(the dad of my daughter's old friend), he was kind enough to call me and
give me the bad news. This time the conclusion was a high grade, fast
growing cancer consistent with traditional bladder cancer but with a non
traditional development. The biopsy was reviewed by a few pathologists and
they all concluded the same even though there was a hint of doubt as to the
type of cancer.

I was at work sitting in my office when I got the call and I only recall the
event as surreal and numbing. Strangely enough, there was also some relief
as I finally knew what was going on and I could imagine a path to recovery.

My urologist offered to let this sink in first and come and see him in a few
days or keep the appointment that same afternoon. I kept the appointment and
after telling my wife the results in person (an emotional moment I dreaded
all the way home), we both went to see him.

The recommendation from my urologist was to remove the bladder, prostate,
seminal vesicle and lower lymph nodes (called a
[radical cystectomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystectomy) and to sweep
up remaining cancer cells with chemo afterwards. He did not perform this
procedure himself but the urology group (about 30 doctors) had a few people
who did.

My basic options were a) go with experience and use a doctor who has done a
lot of them but does it by hand or b) go with a young whiz kid who has only
done them using the
[Da Vince robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Vinci_Surgical_System)
but might lack experience. I decided to be a rebel and go young. I already
figured out this was a fast moving field and I wanted somebody who still
had two legs in the academic world and could go robotic. The Da Vince
procedure for removal and reconstruction was developed at
[Johns Hopkins Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_Hospital) in
[Baltimore, MD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore) and having
someone from the joystick generation operating the machine appealed to me.
The robot is far more accurate, reduces recovery time and minimizes side
effects.

BTW: in this blog, the terms "whiz kid" and "joystick generation"
are terms of endearment and respect. As an older person who lived his
live pursuing innovations, I have the deepest respect for those who
continue to pursue state of the art developments. In the end, I picked
the right team and I will forever see them as heroes.

### Colonoscopy, 5 March 2019

As luck might have it, I was already scheduled for a colonoscopy. This was
now very important to me as a part of my intestines could be used as a
replacement for my bladder. Obviously, the colon is a "long way" away from
the part that would be used as a replacement but I have a few colleagues
whose colon cancer ended up in removal of all intestines. I wanted to make
sure there was no cancer in those regions.

Initially my gastroenterologist wanted to wait for the result of the scan
and biopsy and canceled my appointment. With charm and persistence, I got
a quick appointment with a Registered Nurse (RN) at the same office and
she got my an urgent colonoscopy within days. Again the bureaucracy was
ridiculous as the scheduler said the next appointment was in 6 weeks.
When the RN put the cancer word on the table, I got an appointment in 2
days.

During previous colonoscopies, pre-cancerous polyps were found/removed and
I was on a 3 year schedule. This time, only 2 small bumps were removed.
They were also pre-cancerous and the doctor put me on the 5 year program.
I saw this as good news as nothing was in the way of getting a
"neo bladder" made from my intestines.

### On to Urologist number Three, 5 March 2019

Since I'm now pushing the medical system to the brink, I had an appointment
with my young urologist on the same day as my colonoscopy. I fully expected
that we would make a plan for removal, reconstruction and chemo but my
doctor had other plans.

His first point was that this is war and in war you have to know your
enemy (this is what I heard, not necessarily what he said). He was not
convinced we knew enough about the cancer yet as my cancer did not start
in a traditional way, the pathology was not 100% conclusive and during
the first biopsy they did not get samples from my bladder's muscle (this
is important to determine if we are dealing with stage 1 or 2).

He recommended a second, deeper biopsy and sent the specimens to high
frequency labs where they see more cases like this. The second military
point was that in war, you have to know your own abilities, and he wanted
to know more about me. He ordered an upper body CT scan with contrast to
ensure we did not miss anything and to ensure my heart and lungs were
healthy enough for aggressive treatment.

The average age of a bladder cancer patient is in their early 70s and often
these people have other complications and they have to balance treatment
with conditions like diabetes, heart problems or high blood pressure. The
upper body scan came back clean so for now, I know my cancer is limited to
my bladder.

### Biopsy Number Two, 15 March 2019

My second biopsy was one for the ages. Not only did the surgeon have the
same stricture problem as the first one, he also decided to scrape away
most of the cancer cells from my bladder wall. We don't know why he did
that but from the beginning he had stated that if possible, he would like
to save my bladder. I assume his thinking was that since he's causing all
this pain anyway, he might as well remove the cancer to give him more
treatment options.

After surgery, he talked to my wife but wisely stayed away from me as I
might have hurt him. For two days the pain was so bad that if someone had
offered a medical coma, I would have taken it. There was significant
bleeding but I guess that was to be expected. Luckily, I'm still in decent
shape and my body recovered quickly. I stopped taking opioids after a
few days and my urine was almost running clear in a week (it's amazing how
fast our body can heal itself). Like the first biopsy, I had a catheter for
one week to make it heal faster.

### Update, 20 March 2019

My urologist was nice enough to call me with the biopsy results and not]let me wait until the appointment one week later. The second biopsy confirmed
the results of the first one. I have high grade bladder cancer and this
time they confirmed it did spread to the bladder muscle. This means I have
stage 2 cancer and his recommended procedure is chemo followed by bladder
removal/reconstruction. This is the reverse sequence of what the first two
urologist recommended, but a simple Google search confirmed that the
younger generation was right as that is today's thinking based on solid
academic research.

My urologist also made an appointment with an oncologist within a few days
and I would start 4 rounds of chemo shortly thereafter. My big robot
surgery will be sometime in July/August. Recovery from that surgery will be
8 weeks.

Since I was already prepared for this after the first biopsy, I'm OK with
this approach. All the uncertainty from the first biopsy is now removed and
the war on cancer can now start for real. I'm definitely liking the idea of
chemo first since it will catch any cancer cells that might have escaped
from my bladder.

The last 10 days have been extremely painful. First the bladder
biopsy surgery where an area of 2 by 4 inches was scraped away and later
the catheter that made it impossible to sit, stand or do anything without
pain. Once the catheter was removed I became more mobile even though the
pain is not yet gone. Getting good sleep is still hard but I do feel a
small improvement every day.

### Update, 28 March 2019

I was too optimistic about the fast recovery from the second
biopsy. The last couple of days have been very painful and I'm back on
opioids. I was told this could happen but I assumed it would not happen to
me. I was wrong (again).
