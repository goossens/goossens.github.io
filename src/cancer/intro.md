Welcome to my "War on Cancer" blog. On this page I chronicle my battle
with and full recovery from stage 2 muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
The story is in chronological order meaning that the latest news is at
the bottom. You can simple scroll through the story or use the navigation
link at the top right to jump to a specific section. The last update of
this blog was on 14 December 2021.

The motivation for this blog was to inform my family and friends who are
spread out over 10 time zones. Initially I sent emails to those interested
but as the list grew, it became too hard to track whom I told what.
A second purpose of this blog is to inform others who may one day find
themselves in the same predicament.

Even though events in this blog happened in the past, most of them
are described in the present tense as this was my "diary" during the journey.
