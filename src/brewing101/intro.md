Hi, My name is [Johan Goossens](index.html) and I've been brewing beer
as a hobby for over 10 years. You can see my own current setup and
recipes on my [Brewing](brewing.html) page.

In 2018, I did a quick beer brewing 101 with demonstration for a
number of my colleagues. When I retired, I was cleaning up files and
found the materials I used. So now that I have time on my hands, I
decided to publish this knowledge so others can benefit as well.
Please use the arrow below to start the tutorial.
