The purpose of **the boil** is twofold. Firstly, we need to sterilize the
liquid and secondly, we need to **bitter up** the **sweet wort** with
**hops** and turn it into a **bitter wort** that becomes the beer we
all love.

On the first point, it is important to recognize that cleanliness and
sterilization are important in beer brewing. We don't want bacteria to
enter our final product causing possible health hazards but we also
don't want bad smells or awful flavors. The boil is the final step
in sterilizing our wort and from the moment we end the boil, we enter
a world where extreme caution is required and the focus has to be on
food safety and product quality.

For most recipes however, the boil is about bittering the wort in
accordance with the style you are going for. Do we want a semi-sweet
Pilsner or do we want an over-the-top, super bitter IPA or anything
in between? Well, there are as many answers to this question as there
are beer recipes. Hops come in a variety of flavors and they all cause
a different effect based on how much you use and how long they are part
of the boil. I would submit that the popularity of micro breweries
is to a large extent a direct result of hop varieties and the endless
combinations of using new ones with well established ones.

### Hop Schedule

If you study beer recipes, even those that are clones of well known
commercial products, the **hop schedule** always seams to be different.
Now, when you just start to brew beer, this can be a daunting challenge
but in the end, this is a great area for experimentation. Imagine a
classic Belgian recipe but using citrusy hops from California
instead of traditional European varieties. For some this might be
sacrilegious but for others, this might be the perfect confused beer
that gets them exited about the next batch. Like cooking, brewing beer
gives you the option to stay with tradition or explore new
possibilities.

So let's come back to planet earth and boil our wort. Typically a boil
is between 60 and 90 minutes and we have points during that time where
we add hops. It is very typical to have different hop varieties in a
single recipe and people often use terms like aroma or bittering hops
to describe the ingredients of their hop schedule.

So, where do we get our hops? Obviously, we can grow hops in our backyard
if we have room for very tall vines (25 to 30 feet) that quickly turn
into a jungle if we don't manage them. For most of us city dwellers,
this is not an option so we buy hops from a home brew supply store
who sells them either as dried flowers or compressed pellets.
I have to admit that I've tried both forms and in the end, I like all of
them based on brewing technique. If you throw them straight into a boil,
whole dried flowers are easier to remove because pellets fall apart.
If you use some sort of hop filter or hop spider, pellets are just as easy
and given that more hop varieties are available in pellet form
(at least where I live), I typically use more pellets than dried flowers.

### International Bitterness Units (IBUs)

In beer brewing, bitterness can be measured using
[International Bitterness Units or IBUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Bitterness_Units_scale). A lower number
indicates a beer that is less bitter like a German Hefeweizen and
a higher number indicate high bitterness like many of today's IPAs.
Many breweries, bars and restaurants have started to list the IBU level
of their beers so learning the scale not only helps when you brew,
it also let's you pick a favorite style while ordering a beer.

![IBUs](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.027.jpeg)

For homebrewers, it is hard to measure IBUs as the test equipment is
very expensive. You can however calculate the IBU level of your brew
if you know the acid level of the hops used and the boil duration of
those hops. Most beer recipe apps have a builtin calculator and the
[resources](#resource) section below has links to popular app.

### End of the Boil

As pointed out before, the end of the boil is the point where we need
to become very focussed on cleanliness and sterilization. While
our wort is still simmering and bittering, the liquid is guaranteed
to be sterile but from the moment we start to lower the temperature,
we need to make sure we keep nasty stuff out of our wort to
ensure the best possible product. Step one in this process is to get
the wort down in temperature (from boiling to roughly room temperature)
as soon as possible. We don't want the wort to sit around for too long
in an open vessel as that is an invitation for contamination.

### Cooling the Wort

The most economical way to cool the wort is to use a wort chiller like
in the picture below. By running cold water through the chiller, the wort
can quickly be lowered in temperature. In the winter this goes faster as
tap water is colder than in the summer. This is why beer brewers use
all kinds of techniques to speed this up. Some use a pre-chiller to make
the water colder, others use ice water and a circulating pump.
Professionals might even use industrial glycol chillers to speed up
the process. I've always used a regular chiller and it has served me well.

### Keeping it Sanitized

To keep things sterilized, everything that touches the beer after the
boil must be sterilized. Obviously you can use heat to do this by
putting things first in an oven or dishwasher but for most of us, the
use of food grade sanitizers is fast and effective. These sanitizers
(like StarSan) are used by many brewers as well as other parts of the
food industry. Any object you want to sterilize has to be in contact with
the sterilizer for a minute or so and you can use it immediately
without drying as the sterilizer is food safe. This is really simple
and effective.

![Sanitizers](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.029.jpeg)

In my case, I make a 2 gallon batch of sanitizer on brew day
(you buy it concentrated and only need 1 once per 5 gallons) and use
it to sanitize spoons, hoses and the fermentation vessel.

### Measuring Gravity

Once we transfer our bitter wort from the boiling vessel to a fermentation
vessel, we have one more optional step. If we want to figure out how
strong our beer will be, we can measure the alcohol level at
the end of fermentation but this requires very expensive lab equipment.
An alternative is to measure the wort's gravity (amount of dissolved
solids (mainly sugars) in the liquid) before and after the fermentation.
Based on these number we can determine how much sugar has been converted
to alcohol (telling us the strength of the beer) and how much sugar is
still left in the beer (telling us how sweet or dry the beer will be).

![Gravity](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.030.jpeg)

The simplest way to measure gravity is to use a hydrometer that uses
buoyancy to perform the measurement. This is a low cost solution used by
many homebrewers. An alternative is to use a
[refractometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractometer) that measures
the refraction of light going through a liquid. Higher gravity causes
more refraction. Hydrometers are cheaper than refractometers but require
a larger sample.
