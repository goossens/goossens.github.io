Assuming we see getting all the ingredients as step zero, the fun starts
with step one: **the mash**. So we haven't even started yet and we can
already raise a first point. Where do all these crazy brewing terms
come from? Well, I have no idea but I always suspected that
beer brewers were a little drunk and simply bastardized common words.
Just stand in from of a mirror, pull a silly face and say the words
mash and wort 20 times. Now do it after a few beers. You'll see what I mean.

The idea behind the mash is to extract sugars from fermentables that
we can later turn into alcohol. For today's homebrewers there are
two and half ways to handle this step. Firstly, we're going to
look at using **malt extracts** which were created by someone else. Think
of it as outsourcing the first step so we don't have to start with a lot
of equipment. Using extracts, everybody can make beer on the kitchen
stove. Secondly, we'll look at **whole grain** mashing which is what beer
makers have been doing for centuries. This process is a little more
complex and requires more equipment.

### Extract brewing

As stated above, extract brewing is an entry level technique to allow
as many people as possible to start with the hobby. Two types of
extracts can be purchased from a homebrew store and often they sell
them in kits to include the other ingredients as well. In both cases
someone else has extracted sugars from fermentables and we just
simply add them to water. Dry Malt Extract or DME comes in powder form
and Liquid Malt Extract or LME comes as the name suggests in liquid form.

![Extract Brewing](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.022.jpeg)

I've used both types and I have a preference for DME since it can be
bought in a very light color and it doesn't have that caramel taste
that I so often had with LME. Please note that others swear by LME
but they may be making a different style of beer. For my Belgian
style Tripels, Witbier and Pale Ales, light DME was better.

Using an extract massively simplifies the early steps (as we will see
later). In the end, mashing is as simple as dissolving, mixing and
starting the boil.

![Dissolve and Boil](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.023.jpeg)

Earlier I stated there were two and a half ways of mashing and I was
referring to a hybrid approach between *extract* and *whole grain* brewing.
Often kits have a small amount of crushed grain that will be steeped
in water of a certain temperature (often around 155F) for 30 minutes
or so. You only need a bag for this and it's basically the same idea as
steeping thee. The benefit of that is that you can add interesting
flavors and it gives the sensation that the beer is more fresh and
rich. The entire time I did extract brewing, I used this style.

![Steeping](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.024.jpeg)

So if you are only interested in extract brewing, you can skip the rest
of this section and go straight to the [boiling process](#boiling).
In fact, if you never brewed before, I recommend you do this as the
next part of this section is probably the most complicating part
of beer making. Once you understand the whole process, come back
here and learn how it's done for real.

### Fermentables

All beer brewing is based on converting sugars into alcohol so let's
have a look at where these sugars come from. Firstly, there are the
traditional fermentables like barley, wheat and rye. Most beers are
made from sugars extracted from these grains.

![Fermentables](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.005.jpeg)

It is also possible to use other sources for our sugars and these
are typically added to the grains above for flavor (think of fruity beers
like Kriek Lambic) or to make stronger beers (like adding beet sugar for
strong Abbey Ales). It is also possible to make alcoholic beverages by
just using these fermentables. Think of wine or hard seltzers but these
are obviously not [beers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer).

![Fermentables](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.006.jpeg)

### Malting Barley

So how do we extract sugars from grain? Well, let's start with Barley.
It turns out that it's not easy to get the sugars released from it.
The slide below sums up our problem.

![Barley](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.007.jpeg)

So to get to the sugars, a three step process called **malting**
is used. Firstly, the grains are steeped to soften them up and then a
germination process is started to open them up. Obviously we don't want
to grow fields of barley at this point so we need to stop the process.
Through a drying/roasting process, the germination process is halted
and the barley is now ready for our brewing process.

![Malting](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.008.jpeg)

Since the barley is roasted at the end of the malting process, different
roasting times and temperatures will result in different products just
like with coffee. Malts can therefore be roasted lightly to dark which
results in a different color and flavor. Lighter beers typically uses
malts from a lighter roast and darker beers like stouts use a darker roast.

The level to which the malt is roasted is measured in
[degrees lovibond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_measurement#Colour)
which measures the color of the resulting beer. Lighter beers like
lagers have a low number and darker beers like stouts have a higher
number.

![Lovibond](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.009.jpeg)

Some of you might already be getting scared at this but but don't fear,
the malting process is typically done in large industrial facilities.
As home brewers, we simply buy the malt in the color we want for our
recipes. In fact, I don't know of a single home brewer that malts his/her
own grain even though I assume they exist.

Beer making supply stores typically offer up a wide variety of malts
and they typically come whole or crushed. I always buy mine crushed
as I don't own a malt crusher. My local store crushes the malt to my
liking and since I use it immediately, it's just as fresh as when I
would do it myself. Many home brewers however crush their own grain
as they want full control over the process (e.g. determine coarseness).

![Crushing](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.010.jpeg)

### Extracting Sugars

Now we're finally ready to extract those sugars from our malt.
I'll first explain the manual way and later explain how we
can simplify and/or automate this process.

Sugar extraction is the process of creating **sweet wort**,
which is typically a three step affair: **mashing** to extract the sugars,
**lautering** to filter the wort and **sparging** to get the last sugars
from the grain.

![Extracting](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.011.jpeg)

Mashing is where we add warm **strike water** to the crushed grain which
is typically at room temperature. A little bit of math is involved
here as we want the combination of warm water and cool grain to end up at
the desired mash temperature. Luckily these days there are great apps
and websites that will do these calculations for us. The temperature
of the mash is important is it determines how the sugars are extracted
and what kind of sugars we want. The science behind this is way
beyond a Brewing 101 but at the bottom of this page is a reference to
a book that explains it all. Warning thougH: there is some serious
chemistry and biology involved here.

![Mashing](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.012.jpeg)

Throughout the mashing process (or just at the end), we use the
**grain bed** to filter the sweet wort which is called **lautering**.
Lautering is done by circulating liquid from the bottom of the
**mash tun** to the top either by hand or with a pump. Mash tuns
typically have false bottoms to support this and the grain bed does
a great job at catching the small particles that resulted from crushing
the grain.

![Lautering](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.015.jpeg)

Once the mashing and lautering processes are completed, it is time to
separate the sweet wort from the grain and rinse the grain to extracted
every last bit of sugar. This is called **sparging** and people have come
up with a lot of ways to do this. Sparging is typically done with water
warmer than the wort.

As you can see later, if you automate the mashing and lautering process,
there are plenty of people who argue that sparging is not even required.

So if this wasn't obvious before,
beer brewing is a religion and everybody has their own opinion. I can
guarantee you that posting this simple 101 online will draw fire from
the high priests of home brewing. Don't be discouraged by these types
though, you'll soon be making better beer than they are.

![Lautering](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.016.jpeg)

### Mashing Equipment

As you figured out, extracting sugars is a complicated process and
home brewer ingenuity has gone crazy over the years on how to do this
on a small scale and within budget. Firstly, there the people
(including me) that used gravity and manual labor to move the wort
through the process. This makes for a long brew day with a lot of steps
and heavy lifting. As a beer drinker, I alway though this was a good
idea as I was burning some of the calories I would consume later.

![Equipment](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.017.jpeg)

Secondly, there are people who invest a lot of money and create a mini
version of a commercial brewery with stainless steel vessels and
pumps. Both this and the manual/gravity method will work but in both
cases, you have a lot of stuff to clean at the end of your brew day.
Again, this could be a positive as you're burn calories before you
consume them.

![Brewery](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.018.jpeg)

In my case, I took an intermediate step and went from extract brewing
to **brew in a bag**.  With this technique, you are extracting sugars
from your grain in the same vessel that you use for the boil.
The idea is really simple as you steep your grains in a large
brew pot just like steeping thee for the entire city of London
in one go (slight exaggeration).

This step allowed me to move to whole grain brewing without a great
investment (I already had a fancy brew pot for extract brewing) and
I felt like I was moving forward. My only negative was that my sugar
extraction efficiency was poor and my beers weren't measuring up
to the Belgians I was trying to recreate.

![Brew in a Bag](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.019.jpeg)

Given that "brew in a bag" was not going to get me to make my
favorite Abbey Brews, I did go down the manual/gravity
mashing route described above for a while. Unfortunately my patience
and endurance were not compatible with this approach and my beer
quality became inconsistent and unpredictable. It was time to either
go back to extract brewing (nothing wrong with that as I managed
to make some great beers using this technique) or to find a
different way.

The answer turned out to be an electric all-in-one brewing system
that automates the mashing. lautering and boiling process. This is
also a significant investment but it simplifies the brewing process
and it offers a repeatable process that creates a more consistent
outcome. So I've invested in a Braumeister and never looked back.

![Braumeister](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.020.jpeg)

### Multi-Step Infusion

When you use the manual mashing process, it can be very hard to
keep the temperatures at the right level. This is why I always did
single step infusions where you try to keep the mashing temperature
as constant as possible during the entire mashing process.

Once you move to an all electric system, you can move to a multi-step
infusion process where you use different temperatures to extract the
sugars. This is the process used by commercial beer brewers as it
allows them to extract more and the right kind of sugars to achieve the
effect they are after. If you are interest in this, the links at the
bottom of this page will recommend books and web site that will explain
chemical processes like the acid rest, protein rest, starch conversion
or saccharification and diacetyl rest. This stuff will make your brain
hurt long before you have a hangover.

![Multi-step](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.013.jpeg)

As I'm interested in Belgian Ales, I quickly learned of a man called
Jean de Clerck who was and probably still is one of the most influential
beer brewing scientist. So until I fully understand the chemistry
behind the mashing processes, I've adopted his **mash schedule**
for a number of my Belgian recipes.

![Jean de Clerck](class:rounded:img-fluid:img/brewing101/brewing.014.jpeg)

If you made it to this part of this tutorail, you deserve a medal.
The mashing process to extract sugars and create sweet wort, is the
most complicated part of beer brewing. you can see why beginners start
with extract brewing. I must say however that by investing in electric
brewing, I have simplified the process as well and the automation
allows for very consistent products. If I could only understand all
the chemistry behind all of this so I could reason an outcome rather
than rely on trial and error.
