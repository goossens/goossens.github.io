Like everything else in the world, making beer is simple as long as you
follow the process. In this overview, the homebrew process is split into
six steps that are executed sequentially. Each of these steps in a section
and you can read them sequentially or use the navigations links at
the top of the page.

* [The Mash](#mashing) - Extracting sugars from “fermentables” making “sweet wort” (sugar water)
* [The Boil](#boiling) - Boil “sweet wort” and bitter it with “hops” making “bitter wort”
* [The Fermentation](#fermenting) - Ferment “bitter wort” with “yeast” converting sugars into alcohol and C02
* [The Maturation](#maturing) - Mature and clarify the “flat beer” in a “secondary” (optional)
* [The carbonation](#carbonating) - Bottle or keg beer and let it carbonate (add the bubbles)
* [The Enjoyment](#enjoying) - Enjoy your masterpiece

So you see, it's really simple: you extract sugars, put them in a liquid,
boil it and make it bitter, turn the sugar into alcohol, make it pretty
and carbonate it. Everybody can do this.
