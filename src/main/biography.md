![Johan Goossens](class:float-right:rounded-circle:ml-3:img/main/johan.jpg)
Johan Goossens was born on June 3rd, 1960 in
[Bergen op Zoom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen_op_Zoom),
a small town (~40.000 people at the time) in the south of
[The Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands).
In the early 70s, he developed a great interest in electronics which
rapidly developed into an electrical and software engineering
obsession.  At the age of 14, he collected first generation TV sets (to
reuse the tubes) and through his parents he met a
[Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips) research engineer who
donated boxes full of experimental electronic parts and tons of old
electronics magazines. Johan read every one of those magazines and soon
started to build fun projects like radios, oscilloscopes and amplifiers.
At the age of 16, he even build a small 'computer' based on Intel's very
first chip. The [Intel 4004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004)
based JoGo computer (as in Johan Goossens) was battery powered, had 40
bytes of memory (no, I did not forget the word kilo, mega or giga),
switches and push buttons for input and 4 red LEDs for output.

Slowly the electronics obsession turned to music and soon enough speaker
cabinets, amplifiers, effects boxes and light shows were created.
Initially, Johan ran a 'mobile disco' with friends but playing DJ was not
satisfying enough so after discussions with school buddies, Johan, Willem
and Marc decided to start a band. Marc was a classically trained acoustic
guitar player who could sing very well, Willem decided to learn the bass
and Johan added percussion to his list of obsessions.

As with most teenage bands, the early days were rough and the band quickly
went through a number of different lineups. Johan and Marc remained a
constant, Marc's sisters (Nicole and Vivianne) added great vocals, Leo and
later Don (no mafia connections) replaced Willem on bass and finally Suus
and later Ruud added electronic piano/keyboard to the mix.
"[Hippo](/hippo)" became a popular local band
but military service and other real life interruptions made the band
members drift apart.

![Roncalli](class:float-left:rounded:p-2:img/main/Roncalli.jpg)
During those band years, most musicians went to the same high school
([Roncalli Scholengemeenshap](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/SG_Roncalli))
that had a unique education style based on the
[Dalton Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_Plan) (Dalton Systeem
in Dutch). In this system, students are given a lot of freedom to
determine their own speed of learning and many classes are a strange
combination of classic lectures, discussion and interaction. For Johan,
this turned out to be very important as he clearly belonged to the
crippling introverts tribe. Without Roncalli, he would have never been
able to learn how to act as an extrovert.

One interesting thing however that could have changed the course
of history. As a shy young man, Johan typically did not engage in the
historical, political or social discussions during history and civics
classes (same teacher). One day during elections in the Netherlands,
Johan (out of the blue) decided to speak up and he voiced his slightly left
of center progressive views. This was clearly not appreciated by his
far left teacher who put him down immediately with those famous words:
*"What do you know about this? You're just the son of a milkman!"*.
Well, that encounter could have made Johan an extremely
crippling introvert for the rest of his life but something special
happened. The other students did not accept the teachers reaction and
picked a fight with him for being elitist and discriminatory. A debate
raged for 2 hours (Johan took part as well) and at the end, the teacher
apologized (half heartedly). Johan's extrovert journey had started.

![Eifel](class:float-right:rounded:p-2:img/main/Eifel.jpg)
To avoid conscription in the
[Royal Netherlands Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Netherlands_Army), Johan voluntarily joined the
[Royal Netherlands Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Netherlands_Air_Force)
in 1981 as a cadet at the Air Officers School in
[Gilze-Rijen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilze-Rijen_Air_Base).
During his time in the service (the
[Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War)),
Johan worked on the multinational Air Command and Control system EIFEL in
[Birkenfeld, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkenfeld)
as a programmer/analyst. He left the Royal Netherlands Air Force in
1988 as a Captain to pursue a civilian career with
[NATO Headquarters SACLANT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Allied_Commander_Atlantic) in
[Norfolk, VA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk,_Virginia).

As in most bands, the drummer gets the pretty girl and during the Hippo
years, Johan started to date Nicole (yes, the singer of the band and
sister of his best friend). In 1983, Nicole also moved to Germany and
in 1988, they got married and moved to the US.

From 1988 to 1993, Johan worked for SACLANT as the System Software
Section Chief in support of maritime command and control. In 1993, Johan
and Nicole moved to
[San Diego, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego),
to work at the US Navy Research Laboratory NOSC/NRaD (now called the
[Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Information_Warfare_Center_Pacific)) as the NATO liaison officer.

In 1998, Johan returned to Norfolk, VA, to take the position of
User Domain Support Branch Head for the ACLANT System Support Center (ASSC).
In that role he was responsible for rapid system development, in-service
support and training for some NATO systems. These products constantly
adopted emerging technologies, saw 15 major updates in 12 years and were
proliferated throughout the entire Alliance and numerous NATO/Partner Nations (at one point there were more than 400 installations in 25
countries).

After years of not playing in a band, Johan started
[Mid-Life Crises (MLC)](/mlc) in 1999 and very soon Nicole joined.
An old passion was rediscovered and lots of dollars later,
The Goossens' house was full of PA equipment, a recording studio and a
light show.

![ACT](class:float-left:rounded:p-2:img/main/ACT.png)
In 2006, Johan became the
[ACT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_Command_Transformation)
Technology and Human Factors Branch Head responsible for ACT’s Command
and Control (C2) Concept Development, ACT’s Cyber Defence program,
Federated Mission Networking (FMN), Enterprise Architecture,
the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Exercise (CWIX) and
the Think-tank for Information, Decision and Execution superiority (TIDE).
Johan authored the original FMN concept, the NATO C2 Capstone Concept
and was a driver in establishing Cyberspace as an operational domain
in NATO.

From 2007 until 2009, Johan and Nicole also played in a band called
[Cujo Panic](cujopanic). Sadly both [MLC](/mlc) and Cujo Panic are
currently on an Eagles-style "until hell freezes over" break which
led to the "[Rock on 11](rockon11)" initiative where they try to make
great covers of popular classic rock songs.

In 2018, Johan established the ACT
[Federated Interoperability Branch](https://www.act.nato.int/federated-interoperability)
responsible for capability planning, interoperability standardization,
verification and continuation. In this capacity, he acted as the
Chairman of the multi-national FMN Capability Planning Working Group
(CPWG), continued to work on C2 concepts and researched advanced
application of data science and artificial intelligence in NATO.

In 2019, Johan got diagnosed with stage 2 bladder cancer. You can read
his entire story in his "[war on cancer](waroncancer.html)" blog.
After a 20 month battle with cancer and numerous infections, Johan is now
cancer free and getting back to a regular life.

![MSM](class:float-right:rounded:p-2:img/main/MSM.png)
On January 1st, 2021, Johan retired after almost 40 years of continuous
international service. Johan was awarded the prestigious
[NATO Meritorious Service Medal (MSM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_Medal#NATO_Meritorious_Service_Medal)
in 2013 and the Golden Badge of the Estonian Ministry of Defense in 2015.

Today, Johan and Nicole happily live in
[Virginia Beach, VA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Beach,_Virginia)
were both spend time on their hobbies. Johan and Nicole have 2 children:
Martijn and Melanie.
