During my [cancer treatment](waroncancer.html), I had a hard time
focussing and I spent a lot of time watching TV and YouTube. During
this period, I became fascinated with
[Steampunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk).
On YouTube there are many very talented people who create beautiful
contraptions. A good example is the fine work by a Greek artist called
Roman Parkhin. On his
[BanjoShow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwzpraxiLapi_cbDAi5ZDRw)
YouTube channel, you can find some great ideas like this
[Steampunk Lamp Art Sculpture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yp7B-WRDoVw).

Initially I wanted to try this out myself but I was quickly discouraged
as most of the Steampunk artists were experts in
[metalworking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalworking) and
[machining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machining).
For a second, I though I could pull this off using simple
[woodworking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodworking)
techniques but that was never going to work with my skill level.
A renewed interest was developed when I got into
[3D printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing) which made it
possible to manufacture the required parts using plastic.

Right now, I've finished one project and I'm designing three more.
My plan is to make all the parts Open Source so anybody can criticize
them or even better reuse some ideas and techniques.

* [Steampunk Desk Lamp](/SteampunkDeskLamp) - This project builds a
simple desk lamp that brings together patinated metals with the
illusion of old electronics. In the end, the contraption isn't more
that an LED-based Edison bulb, old non-functional vacuum tubes bottom
lit with LEDs and a few switches and controls. Invisible 3D printed
parts are used to couple metal parts that were never intended to be
joined. The entire "machine" is described on its
[web page](/SteampunkDeskLamp) complete with instructions, parts list,
schematics and 3D models.
* [Nixie Tube Clock](/NixieTubeClock) - This project will produce a
functional four digit clock based on old style
[Nixie Tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixie_tube). The idea is
to take it back to the 1950 with some typical Steampunk metal
embellishments. The whole thing will be driven by an
[Arduino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino) Microcontroller
using a [Rotary Dial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_dial)
as the single user interface.
* [The Punk](/ThePunk) - This project will bring together a human-shaped
lamp (hence the name) with inspiration from Rush's Time Machine Tour
which had a Streampunk stage theme. The purpose of this machine is to
control our music room from a single location. The Punk will
be equipped with a [Rotary Dial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_dial)
that will turn on/off all the power in the room (e.g. by dialing 1).
Right now, more than 10 switches have to be flipped to turn everything
on. The Punk will also be fitted with
[Arduino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino) and
[ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32) microcontrollers.
The later will provide a modern web server so you can also use your
cellphone to control the room. As you can see in the picture below,
The Punk features a rotary switch in his hand. Any of these
three means (rotary dial, cellphone app or rotary switch) can turn
power on and/or off.
* [The Dude](/TheDude) - This project is still in a conceptional phase
but the idea is to create a creepy, non-moving robot that responds
visually to the music being made or played in the studio.
