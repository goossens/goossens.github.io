	Brewing with Friends

Growing up in the southern part of the Netherlands close to the
Belgian border and
[Antwerpen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp),
you can't help but love Belgian beers. Trappist style abbey beer like
[Westmalle tripel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westmalle_Brewery) and
[Leffe Blonde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leffe),
the original white beer from
[Hoegaarden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoegaarden_Brewery) brewery or
a strong Pale Ale from the
[Duvel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duvel_Moortgat_Brewery)
Moortgat Brewery are all special to me.

Moving to Germany in 1982 cut me off from these great beers as the
German ["Reinheitsgebot"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot)
(purity order) did not allow non-German beers to be sold (well, actually
it was about ingredients but the end result was protectionism).
This off course made trips back home more special as I could have my
favorite beers again. I'll have a funny rant about this German
protectionism in my [Beer Making 101](/brewing101) tutorial.

Moving to the US in 1988 did not improve the situation. Most of these
small Belgian breweries did not export to the US or the products were
very hard to find. As Belgium beer became more available, it was the
price that was ridiculous. A small bottle of Westmalle Tripel costs
about 1.40â‚¬ in Belgium and the Netherlands where you pay $6.00 in the US.

The obvious answer was to make my own and I started to
["homebrew"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrewing) in 2010.
Like everybody else, I started with a dry malt extract kit that I made
on the stovetop. The beer was decent but it tasted nothing like my
favorite Belgian beers. Slowly I improved the recipes and started
experimenting with different malts, hops and yeast varieties. Given
that my family was not a fan of the brewing smells, I quickly moved to
the garage.

Eventually I moved to an all-in-one electric brewing kettle, I built
a fermentation chamber out of a chest freezer and I now keg my beer
and dispense it using a
[kegerator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kegerator).

You can find a detailed description of my current setup complete with
my recipes on my [brewing](/brewing) page. For those that have not
yet been exposed to the brewing jargon, I even have a
[Beer Making 101](/brewing101) tutorial for beginners.
