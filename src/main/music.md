	Cujo Panic practice session in our music room

Ever since I was a teenager, I've been involved with music.
Initially this was limited to operating a "drive-in" disco but later
my interest shifted to playing the drums in classic rock bands.
As you can see in my [biography](#biography), this interest in music
went hand in hand with an obsession for electronics and computer
science.

You can read about my musical journey on the web sites below and
you can listen to our music and see why we always kept our day
jobs. Nevertheless, a few master pieces can be found and entertaining
videos and photos capture a journey over more than four decades.

* [Rock on 11](/rockon11) - This is a project I started with my
wife around 2013. In our home studio, we are trying to make the
best possible covers of classic rock songs. In some cases we have
friends help out. In other cases anonymous internet artist are providing
a helping hand. Given that productions are done over time in the studio,
many of the tracks have lots of takes and overdubs. It is very
unlikely that we could ever pull these versions off live. All the
bands below played live and numerous recordings are actually live.
* [Cujo Panic](/cujopanic) - This was a band we played in from 2007
until 2009. As a classic three piece with an additional lead singer,
we had some serious fun cranking out classic rock.
* [Mid-Life Crisis (MLC)](/mlc) - This band was active from 1999
until 2009 and it was our return to playing in a band. MLC played
a combination of pop, soul, blues and rock. Many memorable parties
were organized by this band and some great video footage and
photographs are still available.
* [Hippo](/hippo) - This was our teenage band and it basically
represents the start of our musical journey. Old real-to-real
and cassette tape recordings have been digitized and can be listened
to. Pictures highlight how young we where.
