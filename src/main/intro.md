Welcome to my website! As a retired IT professional who spent an entire
career in international organizations as an engineer and manager (see more
in my [biography](#biography)), I never had much of a web or social media
presence. This website provides access to all my retirement hobbies
and activities. On this site, you'll find a strange combination of a strict
engineering discipline combined with a desire to be an artistic rebel that
doesn't always follow rules and recipes. Yes, you already figured it out,
there is a lot of "do as I say, not as I do" on this site.

To better understand this structured yet rebellious and innovative
attitude, I've been using a quote from the late
[Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs) to explain this to
the people that worked for and with me. I hope Steve and his estate
don't mind fair use of his words as a tribute to his tremendous legacy.

*"Here’s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers,
the round pegs in the square holes… the ones who see things differently —
they’re not fond of rules… You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify
or vilify them, but the only thing you can’t do is ignore them because they
change things… they push the human race forward, and while some may see
them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough
to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do."*
